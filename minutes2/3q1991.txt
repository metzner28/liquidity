RECORD OF  POLICY ACTIONS OF  THE

FEDERAL OPEN  MARKET COMMITTEE

Meeting  Held  on  October  6. 1992

The  information  reviewed  at  this  meeting suggested  that

economic  activity was  expanding at  a subdued  pace.  Domestic  final

sales  appeared to  have  picked  up  in  the  third  quarter,  led  by  an

increase  in  consumer spending  and another  sharp  gain  in  business

purchases  of office  and  computing equipment,  but  demand  had  remained

sluggish  in  most other  sectors  of the  economy.  The  limited  growth  in

overall  demand was  being met  in  part  through higher  imports,  and  as  a

consequence,  industrial  production and  employment  had  been  weak.

Recent  data  on  wages  and prices  continued  to  suggest  that  inflation

was  slowing.

Total  nonfarm payroll employment  fell  somewhat  further in

September,  reflecting  a drop  in government  jobs  associated  with the

end  of  a federally funded  summer jobs  program.  Employment  in the

private  sector  was up  in  September,  as  new hiring in  the  services

industry more than  offset job  losses  in manufacturing and

construction;  employment  in other  industries  was  little  changed after

a sizable  decline in August.  The  civilian unemployment  rate  edged

down to  7.5  percent in September  when the  labor  force  registered

another  decrease.

After  a considerable gain in July,  industrial  production

declined appreciably in  August,  and available  information  suggested

further weakness  in September.  The  decline in  industrial  output  since

July  partly  reflected the  disruptive  effects  of  Hurricane Andrew on

oil  and  gas  production and  of  a labor  strike  on  the manufacture of

automobiles  and parts.  However,  output  of  a broad  range  of other

goods  also  was  down.  One area  of  continuing strength was  the

production of business  equipment, notably  office  and  computing

equipment.  The  utilization  of total  industrial  capacity fell  on

balance  over July  and August,  retracing a portion of  the increase that

occurred  over the  first  half of the year.

Real  personal consumption expenditures  were  little  changed

in August  after  increasing appreciably in the  two previous  months;  for

July  and August  combined,  spending was moderately higher than in the

second  quarter.  In August,  outlays  for  services  continued to  rise,

while expenditures  for most major  categories  of  goods  declined.

Housing  starts  climbed in August, with starts  of  single-family homes

reaching their highest  level  since March.  By  contrast,  permit

issuance  and  sales  of  new and  existing homes  edged  lower in  August.

Shipments  of nondefense  capital goods  slowed  considerably in

July and  August, retracing much of the  sharp  gain recorded in June.

Shipments  of office  and  computing equipment  slackened on  balance over

the  two months:  however,  after adjusting  for  ongoing rapid  declines in

prices,  the  underlying upward trend  in demand for  such  equipment

remained  robust.  Recent  data on  orders  and  shipments  of nondefense

capital  goods  suggested that  business outlays  for  durable equipment,

particularly for  items  other than computers,  would  grow more slowly

in  coming months.  Outlays  for  nonresidential  construction contracted

again  in August, with steep  decreases  occurring for  commercial and

industrial  structures.  Data on  contracts continued  to  indicate that

spending  for new construction would  remain sluggish  over the months

ahead.

Total business  inventories  rose  somewhat  further in July

following  a large  increase in June.  In  manufacturing, inventory

stocks were little  changed over June and  July but  were up  sharply in

August  as  factory shipments  of  goods  slowed;  as  a result, the  ratio  of

inventories to  shipments  for all  manufacturing rebounded  to  the middle

of  the  range  that  had  prevailed  over  the previous  year.  At  the

wholesale  level,  inventories  were  trimmed  a little  in July  after  a

sizable  rise  in  June,  and the  stocks-to-shipments  ratio  remained

relatively  high.  Retail  trade inventories  expanded  at  a considerable

pace  in  July, but  a rebound  in sales  lowered the  inventory-to-sales

ratio  somewhat  at  most types  of stores.

The nominal  U.S.  merchandise trade deficit  widened somewhat

in  July  from its  average  rate in the  second  quarter.  Imports,

particularly of  capital  goods  and  consumer  goods,  remained on  the

fairly  strong upward path  evident  during the  first  half  of the year.

Exports  increased  by a smaller amount  in July;  exports  of agricultural

products  rose noticeably, but  exports  of nonagricultural  goods  were

about  unchanged from the pace of the  previous three  quarters.  Recent

indicators  of economic  activity  in the  major foreign industrial

countries  suggested a continuation of sluggish  growth  on average  in

those  countries.

Producer  prices  of finished  goods  edged  up in  August  in

association  with a rebound  in  prices  of fresh  fruits and  vegetables.

Abstracting from the volatile food  and  energy components,  the  increase

in  prices  of  other finished  goods  over the  twelve months  ended  in

August  was  considerably  smaller than the  rise over  the  previous

twelve-month period.  At the consumer  level,  prices  of nonfood, non-

energy  items  registered another modest  increase,  and  the  twelve-month

change  in this  measure also was  down  substantially  from a year

earlier.  In  September, a drop in  the  average hourly earnings  of

production or nonsupervisory workers  retraced part  of  a sizable rise

in August.  Over the twelve months  ended in  September, these earnings

grew  at  a significantly  slower rate  than  in  the  preceding twelve-month

period.

At  its  meeting  on August  18,  the  Committee  adopted a

directive that  called  for maintaining the  existing degree  of pressure

on  reserve  positions  and that  included a bias toward possible  easing

during the  intermeeting period.  Accordingly,  the directive  indicated

that  in  the  context of the  Committee's  long-run objectives for  price

stability  and sustainable  economic  growth, and  giving  careful

consideration to  economic,  financial,  and monetary developments,

slightly  greater  reserve  restraint might  be  acceptable or  slightly

lesser  reserve restraint  would be  acceptable during  the  intermeeting

period.  The  contemplated  reserve  conditions were  expected to  be

consistent  with  growth in M2  and M3  at  annual rates  of about  2 percent

and  1/2  percent  respectively over the  six-month period  from June

through December.

Open market  operations during the  intermeeting period were

directed  initially toward maintaining the  existing  degree of pressure

on reserve  positions.  In  early  September,  operations were  adjusted to

implement  some easing in reserve pressures.  This  action was taken in

response to  incoming information that  suggested  unexpected

sluggishness  in economic  activity  and  a smaller-than-anticipated

pickup in the  growth  of the broad  monetary aggregates.  Adjustment

plus  seasonal  borrowing  tended to  run  a little  above expected levels

during the intermeeting  interval,  reflecting in part  reserve  short-

falls  that  produced  sharp  increases  in borrowing at  the  end  of two

reserve maintenance periods.  The  reserve  shortfalls along with

quarter-end  pressures contributed  to a somewhat  higher federal  funds

rate  than had been expected following the monetary easing action.

Other  short-term interest  rates  also  declined  somewhat,

while  longer-term  rates were  about  unchanged  since  the  Committee

meeting  on August  18.  Short-term debt markets  reacted to  the

Committee's  easing  action in  early September  and  subsequently to

growing expectations  of further  System easing in  the  context  of

continued  indications of  a sluggish economic  expansion.  Yields  on

intermediate-term  securities  also  fell.  However,  rates  on  long-term

obligations  were little  changed on balance;  the  System's  policy easing

and  generally weak  economic  data  tended to  reduce  bond  yields, but

long-term  debt markets  also  appeared to  reflect  growing  concerns  about

the fiscal  outlook and increased  uncertainty  stemming in part  from

volatility  in the foreign  exchange markets  and policy developments

abroad.

In foreign exchange markets,  the  trade-weighted value  of  the

dollar  in terms  of the  other G-10 currencies  fluctuated widely  over

the  intermeeting period but  ended  somewhat  higher on balance.  The

dollar weakened  considerably  early in the period  on  disappointing

reports  about the U.S.  economy and  related  expectations  of  Federal

Reserve easing.  In mid-September, the  dollar moved  sharply higher  as

turmoil  in  European currency markets prompted  some  safe-haven buying

of dollars  and resulted  in  interest  rate  reductions  in  Germany.  More

recently, reduced  tensions within the European Monetary System and

heightened  expectations of  further easing by the  Federal Reserve

induced  renewed  declines  in the  dollar.

Expansion  of M2  and M3  resumed  in August,  though at  fairly

slow  rates,  and  limited growth  appeared to  have continued  in

September.  Through  September, both  aggregates  were estimated  to have

grown  at  rates  somewhat below the  lower  ends  of the  ranges  established

by the  Committee for the  year.  The  pickup in the  broad  aggregates

seemed to  reflect the  cumulative effects  on demand  deposits  and  liquid

retail  deposits of  declines in market  interest  rates  since mid-year

and  a related drop  in  opportunity costs.  Currency  growth  strengthened

further  in  August  and  September,  evidently owing in  part to  further

foreign  demand.  Bank credit  growth  also picked up  in  both months  in

conjunction with an  upturn in bank loans.

The staff projection prepared for this meeting indicated

that  economic  activity  would expand  at  a slow pace  in  the  current

quarter  and  that  growth would pick up  gradually  in  1993  to  a rate that

would  remain quite  moderate by  past cyclical  standards.  The declines

that  had  occurred in interest  rates  were expected to boost housing

activity to  some extent,  particularly in the  single-family  sector.

Gains  in expenditures  for  equipment were projected  to  be  large  enough

to  raise business  fixed  investment despite sluggish  spending for

nonresidential construction.  As  employment  growth was  restored and

further  improvements  in household balance  sheets  were achieved,

consumer  spending would  strengthen.  The projection  pointed to  some

decline  in  federal  government purchases,  reflecting further  cutbacks

in  defense  expenditures, and weak  spending by  state and  local

governments.  The persisting slack in resource  utilization in this

forecast  was projected to be  associated with additional progress  in

reducing inflation.

In the  Committee discussion of  current  and  prospective

economic  developments, many of the members  expressed disappointment

and  concern about  the sluggish pace  of the expansion, and a number

commented  that the  softening in  several  recent business  indicators

could portend quite  slow economic  growth  over the months  immediately

ahead.  Business  and  consumer sentiment was  relatively depressed and

seemed  to have worsened a bit  further  recently in some  parts  of the

country.  While  further  deterioration  in business  activity  culminating

in  an  economic  downturn  could  not  be  ruled  out,  some of the  very

latest  data  had  a slightly more  positive tone and the members

generally  continued to  view somewhat  stronger  economic  growth as  a

reasonable  prospect  for the year  ahead.  However,  no  important  sector

of  the  economy seemed poised  to  provide much  impetus  to  business

activity,  and the  timing of the acceleration from the presently

sluggish  advance  remained  uncertain.  Nonetheless, declines  over  the

third  quarter  in the  foreign  exchange  value  of the  dollar  and in

domestic  interest  rates--the latter  along the entire maturity

spectrum--suggested improved conditions  for  greater  expansion.

Recently,  these more  favorable  conditions  had been  reflected  in an

upturn  in money  growth  and  bank lending activity.  With regard to  the

outlook for  inflation, the  available  statistics  and anecdotal

information continued to indicate  appreciable progress toward  the

goal  of  price stability.

In the  course  of  the Committee's  discussion, the members

gave  a great  deal  of emphasis to the  uncertainties  that  surrounded  the

economic  outlook,  including potential  developments abroad.  Several

members  commented that  against the background  of  a relatively  weak

expansion, the  recent  volatility in  some  domestic financial  markets

and  in  the  foreign exchange market tended to  underscore  the  risks  of

developments that  could  have  adverse  effects  on the  economy.  Another

key  uncertainty  related to  the ongoing restructuring of business  firms

and of  business and  consumer balance  sheets.  Those  activities  were

continuing  to divert  financial  flows  from spending to  savings  or  debt

reduction,  and  prior experience provided  little  basis  for determining

when such  restructuring might  come  closer to  being  completed  and flows

of  funds  redirected  on balance into more  normal  spending channels.

Nonetheless,  the members drew considerable  encouragement from the

substantial  progress  that  already had  been made by  business  firms  in

improving  their  balance  sheets  and  by many lenders,  notably banking

institutions.  While some  banks  clearly were  continuing to  experience

financial  difficulties, many had  pared their problem assets  and

strengthened their capital  positions.  Moreover,  a growing  number  of

reports  suggested that  banks were intensifying their efforts to  find

creditworthy borrowers,  though when such efforts  might  become  more

general was  another  source of  uncertainty.

Consumer  spending  seemed  to  have been  reasonably well

maintained  in most  parts  of the  country,  including indications  of  some

growth  in  a number of  areas where  overall business  activity  appeared

to  be moving sideways  or  even edging  lower.  At  least  in some  parts  of

the  country, retailers were  expressing moderate  optimism with  regard

to their prospective  sales  during  the  upcoming holiday season.  Even

so,  very  cautious  consumer  attitudes,  associated especially with

concerns  about  employment  prospects,  seemed likely  to  restrain overall

growth  in consumer spending over the next  several months.  Indeed,

barring unanticipated economic developments  leading to  a major

strengthening in employment  opportunities,  continuing  efforts by many

households to  improve their financial  positions  could be expected  in

the  context  of  an already  low saving rate to  limit  the  contribution of

the  consumer  sector to  faster economic  growth for  some  considerable

period.

In their  comments about  developments  in  other key sectors  of

the  economy, members also  cited single-family housing construction as

a source of some  stimulus  in many  regions.  The manufacturing of

related building materials  had exhibited  a corresponding pickup

recently.  Other  construction  activity, notably that  of office

structures,  remained weak, but there  were  reports  of some  improvement

or  continuing growth  in the  construction  of  industrial  facilities  and

public  works  projects  in  some  parts  of  the  country.  In  the  energy

sector,  a firming of  gas  prices was  encouraging  somewhat  greater

production.  On balance,  there  was  little  current  evidence that

construction, other  than  in the  single-family sector,  would  provide

significant  impetus  to the  overall expansion in  the  year ahead.

Likewise,  flagging  demand was  curtailing  the  production  of  aircraft

and  inducing at  least  temporary cutbacks  in  auto  assemblies.  In

addition, the foreign trade  sector was  not  expected to  add

significantly  to demands  on the U.S.  economy despite the  decline in

the  foreign  exchange value  of the  dollar.  While  the  latter  had

fostered large  increases  in tourism from abroad  in a number  of  areas

and  some  domestic  producers  reportedly were  gaining market  share,

recessions  or weak expansion in major  foreign trading nations were

likely to  limit  the  growth  in  foreign demand for  U.S.  goods.

The  fiscal  outlook remained  uncertain.  The  large  federal

deficit  was  still  tending to preclude  the adoption  of spending  or  tax

reduction programs  that  would  increase  fiscal  stimulus,  but  some

members  suggested that  continued  sluggishness  in  the  economy might

well  overcome  current  inhibitions against  new initiatives.  In  any

event,  defense  spending was  on  a clear  downtrend and was  exerting an

adverse  effect on  overall  economic  activity in  many  parts  of the

country.  At  the state  and local  government  levels,  severe fiscal

problems  probably would  continue to  curb  spending and  force  many

jurisdictions to  raise  taxes  so  long as  a relatively weak economy

continued to  hold down  revenues.

With regard  to  the outlook for  inflation, the members were

encouraged  by the further  indications  of a disinflationary  trend in

prices  and  wages,  and  they  saw little  likelihood that  upward  pressures

on  prices  would emerge  over the  next  year or  two  even in  the  context

of  some  pickup  in  the  expansion  of economic  activity.  While  medical,

tuition,  and  some  other  costs were  rising  at  relatively rapid  rates,

members  cited widespread  examples  of very  strong competitive  pressures

in markets  for  goods,  including key agricultural  products,  and  ongoing

efforts  by  firms  to  cut  costs  in the  face of  steady or  even declining

prices  in  the markets  for  their products.  Nonetheless.  business

contacts  still  seemed to  anticipate rising inflation at  some  point

for  the  economy  generally if not  in their  own  industries,  and  long-

term  interest  rates  still  appeared to  embody higher  rates  of

inflation.

In the Committee's  discussion of policy  for the  intermeeting

period  ahead, the members generally  agreed that  current  uncertainties

made  an assessment  of the economic  outlook and the  determination of an

appropriate  course  for monetary policy particularly difficult.  While

the members'  preferences  for  policy implementation  ranged  from the

maintenance of unchanged  reserve  conditions  to  an immediate  easing

move,  a majority indicated that they could  support  a policy

prescription of maintaining unchanged  reserve  conditions for  the

present  while biasing the directive  strongly toward  possible  easing

during the  intermeeting period.

Members who  favored an unchanged  policy stance  argued that

despite  the  softness  in  a number  of recent  economic  indicators they

could  see  no  currently persuasive evidence  of a cumulative  deteriora-

tion  in the  economy.  Moreover, earlier monetary policy easing actions

had  provided  a substantial  amount  of  stimulus to the economy that

would continue  to  exert  its effects  over time.  Real  short-term

interest  rates  were  at  very low levels,  and  intermediate-term rates

had  declined  considerably  since mid-year.  The  reductions  in  interest

rates  had  greatly  facilitated the  progress  already achieved  by

business  firms  and  households  in  restructuring their  debts  and

reducing their  debt  service burdens,  thereby strengthening  the

financial  underpinnings of  the  economy.  The  dollar  recently had been

subject  to  considerable volatility in  the  foreign exchange  markets,

and  there  was  some  risk that an  easing of monetary policy  at  this time

might  tend  to destabilize  it.  These members  concluded  that  the

present  stance  of monetary policy  continued to  reflect  an appropriate

balancing  of the need to  sustain progress  toward  price  stability while

encouraging an  acceptable  rate of economic  growth.

Members  who  favored  an  immediate  easing of policy  believed

that  the outlook for  the  economy and prices  argued  for  a policy move

at  this  time.  These  members acknowledged that a good deal  of

uncertainty surrounded  the  economic  outlook.  However,  there were  some

risks  that  an  already sluggish economy might  weaken  further.  In  the

circumstances,  a prompt  easing move would  be a desirable  and prudent

course, particularly in a situation where  they saw  a minimal  risk that

inflation would  be deflected  from its  downward trend.  In the  view of

some  of  these members, continued  expansion in the broad monetary

aggregates  at  rates below the  Committee's ranges  suggested that

financial  conditions were  not yet  conducive  to  a pickup  in  business

activity that was sufficiently robust  to  reduce margins  of

underutilized  resources.  An  easing in monetary policy  seemed to be

widely  anticipated in financial markets,  and  a failure to  take  action

at  this time might well  result  in an undesirable  backup  in market

interest  rates,  thus  further weakening the  outlook.

A majority of the members  noted that  they could  support  an

unchanged directive that  included a decided presumption  of some  easing

if  indications  of stronger  economic  activity  failed  to  emerge  or the

recent  firming in money  and  credit  flows  showed signs  of  ebbing

materially.  It  was  anticipated that  any decision  to  ease  reserve

conditions  during this  period would be  coordinated with the

consideration of a reduction in the discount  rate  by  the Board  of

Governors.  Two members  felt strongly that  a directive  calling for

unchanged  reserve  conditions  should also provide for an  unbiased

intermeeting instruction.  While  such  a directive would  not  rule  out

an  intermeeting  adjustment--in  either  direction--it would  require more

substantial  evidence of  changing or  unexpected economic  or  financial

information before a policy action was implemented.  Several members,

including  some who favored  an immediate  easing of  policy, expressed

some discomfort  about  the  extent  to which the  Committee might  be  seen

as  reacting to  individual pieces  of incoming data  rather than  to  an

accumulation  of  information and  analysis  regarding the  course of the

economy  and  prices.

In the course  of the discussion, members  commented that the

pickup  in the growth  of the broad monetary aggregates  in August  and

September was  a reassuring development,  even though the  rates  of

expansion were  still  quite  sluggish.  According to  a staff  analysis

prepared  for this  meeting, the  growth of both aggregates was likely to

remain quite  limited over the  balance of the year and  to  fall  somewhat

short  of the  lower bounds  of the  Committee's  ranges  for  1992  as  a

whole.  Despite the  lingering effects  of earlier  declines  in  short-

term interest  rates, the projected  expansion of M2  and  especially  that

of M3  would be  expected to  remain below the  growth  of  nominal GDP,  and

the  velocity of these monetary aggregates would  continue to  display

unusual  strength in  comparison with past  patterns.  The  persistence of

slow  growth in the broader aggregates  probably would  involve further

decreases  in  deposit  offering  rates  and  shifts  of  funds  to  higher

yielding alternatives  such  as  bond  and  stock mutual  funds,  with  little

effect  on  consumer  spending  or  overall  economic  activity.  The  members

nonetheless  recognized the  need to  assure  adequate  monetary  expansion

for  a growing  economy  and  noted that money growth  appreciably  below

current  expectations would  be  a matter of increasing concern.  A

differing view focused  on  the  growth of Ml  and reserves,  which had

been very  rapid  since  the  latter  months  of  1991.  In this  view,  the

outsized  growth  in  narrow measures  of  money was  indicative  of  a quite

stimulative  monetary policy, but  given  the  long  lags  that  were

involved, the  inflationary consequences of  such  growth,  if  allowed  to

continue, might  not  become evident  until much later,  perhaps not  until

well  into  1994.

At  the conclusion  of the  Committee's  discussion, a majority

of the members  indicated their  acceptance of a directive that called

for  maintaining the existing degree of  pressure on  reserve positions

and  an understanding that  there would  be  a marked bias  toward  possible

easing  during the intermeeting  period.  Two  of the  members  expressed  a

strong  preference for  a symmetric directive with regard to  possible

intermeeting policy adjustments, while two  others were  firmly

persuaded  of the desirability  of  an  immediate  increase  in  reserve

availability to  strengthen the  growth  of M2.  Accordingly, in  the

context  of  the  Committee's  long-run  objectives  for  price  stability  and

sustainable  economic  growth,  and  giving careful  consideration  to

economic,  financial,  and monetary developments,  it was  decided  that

slightly  greater monetary restraint might be  acceptable  or  slightly

lesser monetary restraint  would be  acceptable during the  intermeeting

period.  The  reserve  conditions  contemplated at  this  meeting were

expected to be  consistent  with  growth in  M2  and M3  at  annual  rates  of

about  2 and  1 percent  respectively over the  three-month period from

September through December.

At  the conclusion of  the meeting, the  following domestic

policy  directive was  issued to the  Federal Reserve  Bank of New York:

The information reviewed  at  this meeting suggests
that  economic  activity is  expanding  at  a subdued  pace.
Total  nonfarm payroll  employment declined  somewhat
further  in September,  but the  civilian unemployment
rate  edged down to  7.5 percent.  Industrial production
is estimated to  have declined  appreciably since  July.
Real  personal consumption  expenditures  appear to  have
risen moderately in the third  quarter.  Data  on housing
have  been mixed, but  on balance they  continue  to
suggest  a gradual  uptrend in housing expenditures.
Recent  data  on  orders  and  shipments  of nondefense
capital  goods  indicate  slower  growth in outlays  for
business  equipment, while  expenditures  for nonresiden-
tial  construction have been weak.  The nominal U.S.
merchandise trade deficit widened  somewhat  in July from
its  average  rate  in  the  second quarter.  Incoming data
on wages  and  prices  suggest that inflation is  slowing.

Short-term interest  rates  have declined  somewhat,
while longer-term rates  are  about  unchanged  since the
Committee meeting on August  18.  In  foreign exchange
markets, the trade-weighted value  of the  dollar  in
terms of the other  G-10  currencies fluctuated widely
over  the intermeeting  period but  ended the period
higher  on balance.

Expansion  of M2  and  M3  resumed  in August,  though

at  fairly  slow rates,  and  limited  growth  appears  to
have  continued  in September.  Through September both
aggregates were estimated  to have  grown  at  rates
somewhat below the  lower ends  of the ranges  established
by  the  Committee  for the year.

The Federal Open  Market  Committee seeks  monetary

and  financial  conditions that will foster  price sta-
bility and  promote  sustainable  growth in  output.  In
furtherance of  these objectives, the Committee  at  its
meeting on June 30-July  1 reaffirmed the  ranges  it had
established  in February for  growth of M2  and  M3  of
2-1/2 to  6-1/2  percent  and  1 to  5 percent  respectively,
measured from the fourth  quarter  of  1991  to the  fourth
quarter  of 1992.  The Committee  anticipated that
developments contributing to  unusual velocity increases
could persist  in the  second half of the  year.  The
monitoring range  for  growth of total domestic  non-
financial debt  also was maintained  at  4-1/2  to 8-1/2
percent  for the year.  For  1993,  the  Committee  on a
tentative basis  set the same  ranges  as  in  1992  for

-15-

growth  of  the  monetary aggregates  and debt  measured
from the  fourth  quarter  of  1992  to the  fourth  quarter
of  1993.  The  behavior  of  the  monetary aggregates  will
continue to  be  evaluated in  the  light  of progress
toward  price  level  stability,  movements  in  their
velocities,  and  developments  in  the  economy and
financial markets.

In  the  implementation  of  policy  for the  immediate

future,  the  Committee  seeks to maintain  the  existing
degree  of pressure  on  reserve  positions.  In  the
context  of  the  Committee's  long-run  objectives  for
price stability  and sustainable  economic  growth,  and
giving careful  consideration to  economic,  financial.
and monetary  developments,  slightly  greater  reserve
restraint  might  or  slightly lesser reserve  restraint
would  be acceptable  in the  intermeeting period.  The
contemplated reserve  conditions  are  expected  to  be
consistent  with  growth  of M2  and M3  over  the  period
from September through  December  at  annual  rates  of
about  2 and  1 percent,  respectively.

LaWare.  Lindsey, and  Melzer.

Messrs.  Jordan and Lindsey preferred immediate action  by

the  Committee to  increase the  availability of bank  reserves

sufficiently to  achieve the  Committee's  pre-announced target  growth

for  M2  in  1992.  Such  reserve  provision would  likely be  associated

with  further declines  in  short-term market  interest  rates.  They

believed that this  policy action  by the  Committee  should be

accompanied by  an  announcement of  reductions  of the  upper  and  lower

limits  of the  range for M2  growth  in  1993.  They felt  that  it was

important  to make  clear  that  near-term action to  increase  M2  expansion

was  not  an  abandonment  of the  long-term  objective  of non-inflationary

monetary growth.

Messrs. LaWare  and Melzer  dissented  because they  did  not

want  to  bias the directive toward  possible easing during the

intermeeting period.  In their view,  a variety of indicators,

-16-

including the  level  of  short-term interest  rates  and  the  growth  of

reserves,  suggested  that monetary policy already was positioned  to

foster  an  expansion  in  economic  activity consistent with  the  economy's

long-run  potential.  Moreover,  further  easing  at  this time  would incur

a substantial  risk of  destabilizing the dollar  in the  foreign exchange

markets.  In  these  circumstances,  they  favored a steady  monetary

policy that was  not  disposed to  react  to near-term weakness  in

economic  data  and that  allowed more time  for the  effects of  earlier

easing  actions to be  felt  in the  economy.  Mr. Melzer  also  expressed

concern that  the progress  already made  toward achieving price

stability might be  jeopardized if very rapid  growth  in M1  were  to

continue.

RECORD  OF  POLICY ACTIONS  OF THE

FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE

Meeting Held  on  June 30-July  1, 1992

The  information  reviewed  at  this meeting suggested  that

economic  activity was  expanding  at  a moderate pace.  Employment  and

industrial  output  had  continued to  rise,  but  a sizable increase  in  the

labor  force had  lifted  the  unemployment  rate  to  a cyclical high.

Increased  sales  and  production of  motor  vehicles were providing  a

boost  to  the  economy,  as  was  higher  spending for  capital equipment,

especially computers.  However,  non-auto  retail  sales  and  homebuying

had  slowed  since  earlier  in the  year,  and  the  latest data  indicated

some widening of  the merchandise  trade  deficit.  Incoming data  on

retail  prices  and  labor  costs  suggested that  inflation was  slowing.

Total  nonfarm payroll employment  increased  for  a fourth

straight  month  in  May,  and  aggregate hours worked by  production  or

nonsupervisory workers  exceeded  the average for  the  first  quarter.

The  services  industry  recorded further  sizable job  gains  in  May, while

employment  in  retail  trade  fell  considerably  and had  changed  little  on

balance thus  far  this  year.  Hiring was  off  slightly  in  manufacturing,

but  further  increases  in  overtime hours  elevated  the  factory workweek

to  a little above  its  average  level  for  the first  half of  1990.  The

civilian unemployment  rate  rose  sharply in  May, to  7.5  percent,

reflecting a surge  in  the  number  of  job  seekers.  Substantial

increases  in  the labor  force  since  late  last  year had  returned the

labor-force  participation rate to  its  average  level  for  the  first  half

of  1990.

Industrial  production rose  appreciably further  in May,

partly  reflecting continued  recovery  in  motor vehicle  assemblies.

Also  contributing to  the rise were  large  increases  in the production

of  other  consumer  durables,  notably household  appliances  and

furniture,  and  of business  equipment.  The  recent  gains  in  production

had  raised the  utilization  of  total  industrial  capacity  considerably,

but  the  average  operating  rate remained  well  below its  July  1990  peak.

After  a surge  early in  the year,  growth  in  real personal

consumption  expenditures had  slowed  despite a strengthening  in the

demand  for motor  vehicles.  In April  and May,  spending  for  goods  other

than  motor  vehicles was  slightly  below the  average  level  for  the  first

quarter,  and  outlays  for  services  increased  only a little.  Purchases

of  new single-family homes  declined  in  May for  a fourth  straight

month.  Starts  of  single-family housing  units  rebounded in  May to  a

level  close  to  the first-quarter  pace,  while multifamily housing

starts  remained  depressed  in  reflection  of  historically high  vacancy

rates  for  such  housing.

Shipments  of  nondefense  capital goods  other  than  aircraft

over  April and  May  were somewhat  above  the first-quarter  level,

boosted  mainly  by  further  increases  for  office  and  computing

equipment.  Business  purchases of  motor  vehicles  also were  stronger.

Recent  data  on  orders  pointed  to  a further pickup  in  business  outlays

for  durable  equipment  over  coming months.  Outlays  for  nonresidential

structures  continued to  trend  lower  in  May, but  incoming  information

on  contracts  for new construction  suggested  that  nonresidential

building activity would decline more  slowly  in  the  months  ahead.

Although construction  of  office buildings  continued  to  plummet  in

response  to  the  substantial  overhang  of  vacant  office  space,  spending

-3-

for  other  nonresidential structures  had firmed  since the fourth

quarter.

Business  inventories  rose  slightly further  in  April.  Stocks

increased  relatively sharply at  the  retail  level,  but  about  half the

buildup was  at  automobile  dealerships, where the  rise  in  inventories

appeared  to  be  about  in  line with  a recent  pickup  in  sales  of  new

vehicles.  In manufacturing, inventories  continued to  decline;  with

factory  shipments  rising, the  ratio  of  stocks  to  shipments  was  at  its

lowest  level  in  more than  a decade.  At  wholesale establishments,

inventories  were  trimmed  substantially further  in  April.  However,

inventory-sales  ratios  remained near  the  high  end of  the  range  that

had  prevailed  over  the  past  several  years.

The  nominal  U.S.  merchandise trade  deficit widened  in  April

and  was  substantially above  its  average rate for  the  first  quarter.

The  value  of  exports  declined,  largely because of  a decline in  exports

of  aircraft.  The  value  of  imports  increased  further  in  April;  a rise

in  imports  of  capital  goods  more  than  offset  a small  decline in

imports  of  consumer  goods.  The  available data  on economic  activity in

the  major  foreign industrial  countries  in  the  second  quarter were

mixed.  In Germany and  Japan,  growth  during the  first  quarter had  been

boosted  by transitory  influences  that  appeared  to be  unwinding in  the

second  quarter.  By contrast,  a moderate  recovery in  economic  activity

was  continuing in  Canada, and  there were  some  indications  that

economic  recovery was  getting under way  in  the United Kingdom.

Producer  prices  of  finished  goods  rose more  rapidly  in  May;

sizable  increases  in  the  prices  of  energy and  other  goods  outweighed  a

further  decline  in  food  prices.  Apart  from anomalous  jumps  in  the

prices  of  a few  items,  however,  increases  in  prices  of  nonfood,  non-

energy  finished  goods  generally remained  modest.  Consumer  prices

posted  a small advance  in  May, despite  a relatively large  rise  in

energy costs.  Excluding food  and  energy items,  consumer  prices

increased more  slowly in  the  first  five months  of  this  year  than  in

1991.  Average hourly earnings  for  production or  nonsupervisory

workers  were  little  changed over  April and  May and  also had  risen more

slowly thus  far  this  year  than  in  1991.

At  its  meeting  on May  19,  the Committee  adopted a directive

that  called  for  maintaining the existing  degree of  pressure  on  reserve

positions  and that  did  not  include  a presumption  about  the likely

direction  of  any adjustments  to  policy  during the  intermeeting period.

Accordingly, the  directive  indicated  that  in  the  context  of  the

Committee's  long-run  objectives  for  price  stability  and  sustainable

economic  growth,  and  giving careful  consideration to  economic,

financial,  and  monetary developments,  slightly greater  or  slightly

lesser  reserve  restraint might  be  acceptable  during the  intermeeting

period.  The  reserve  conditions  contemplated  under  this  directive were

expected to  be  consistent  with growth  of  M2  and  M3  at  annual rates  of

about  2-1/2  and  1-1/2  percent  respectively over  the  two-month  period

from April  through  June.

Open market  operations  during the  intermeeting period were

directed  toward maintaining the  existing degree  of  pressure  on  reserve

positions.  During the  period,  several technical  increases were  made

to  expected  levels  of  adjustment  plus  seasonal  borrowing to  reflect

the  rising demands  for  seasonal  credit.  Actual  levels  of  borrowing

averaged  about  $165  million  over  the  three  reserve maintenance  periods

completed  during  the  intermeeting  interval.  The  federal  funds  rate

remained  close to  3-3/4  percent.

Most  other  interest  rates  changed  little  on  balance  over  the

intermeeting period.  Rates  moved higher  in  the  days  following  the May

meeting  as  widespread market  expectations  of  a monetary  easing  action

were  not  realized.  Later  in  the  period,  however,  interest  rates  fell,

especially at  intermediate maturities,  as  markets  interpreted  incoming

data  on  the  economy  and  the monetary  aggregates  as  indicating  a

sluggish  recovery.  Broad  indexes  of  stock prices  declined  over  the

period  in  response  to  reductions  in  forecasts  of  corporate  earnings.

In  foreign  exchange  markets,  the trade-weighted value  of  the

dollar  in terms  of  the  other  G-10  currencies  declined  further  over  the

intermeeting period.  The  dollar  rose  initially in  response  to  data

pointing  to  a somewhat  stronger  economic  recovery  in  the United  States

but  subsequently more  than  retraced its  gains  as  less  positive

economic  data,  including a  larger-than-expected trade deficit,  were

reported.

M2  and  M3  changed  little  in  May  and  appeared  to have

contracted  in  June;  both  retail and  large-denomination  time  deposits

continued  to  run  off  rapidly.  Depository  institutions,  facing weak

loan  demand  and  intent  on  further  bolstering  capital  positions,  had

reduced  rates  on  time  deposits  fairly  aggressively earlier  in  the

year,  and  as  a  result  these  components  of  M2  and  M3  had  become  less

attractive  relative  to  alternative  investments  or  debt  repayment.  In

addition,  Ml  was unusually  weak in  June.  Through  June,  expansion  of

the  two  broad  aggregates  was  somewhat  below the  lower  ends  of  the

ranges  established by  the  Committee for  the  year.  Growth  of

nonfinancial  debt  was  estimated  to be  at  the  lower  end  of  the

Committee's  monitoring  range.  Borrowing  had  been  concentrated  in  the

capital  markets,  with beneficial  effects  in  reducing  debt  and  debt-

servicing burdens.

The staff  projection prepared  for  this  meeting pointed  to  a

modest  pickup  in  economic  growth  over  the  second  half  of  the year  and

-6-

to  some  further  acceleration  in  1993.  The  forecast  took  into  account

the  lagged  effects  on  aggregate demand  of  earlier  declines  in  interest

rates  and  the progress  that had  been  made  by households  and  businesses

in  strengthening their  balance  sheets.  Nonetheless,  financial  strains

were  expected  to  continue  to  prompt  the diversion  of  some  cash  flows

from business  and  consumer  spending,  though  the magnitude  of  such

adjustments  was  projected  to  lessen  over  time.  Partly  as  a

consequence, moderate  growth well  below that  experienced  during

typical  cyclical upswings  in  the  past  was  projected  in  consumer

spending and  in  business  investment  in  durable  equipment.  Economic

expansion  also  would be  restrained  by  further,  though  diminishing,

declines  in  business  spending on  nonresidential structures  before  a

projected  upturn  in  such  spending began  to materialize  in  the  second

half  of  next  year.  Moreover,  in  the  government  sector,  federal

purchases  of  goods  and  services were  forecast  to  decrease  over  the

projection  horizon,  largely  reflecting  cutbacks  in  defense  spending.

At  the  state and  local  government  levels,  continuing budget  problems

were  expected  to  result  in  a  small  decline  in  real  purchases  during

the  quarters  immediately  ahead and  in  only modest  growth  later.  A

persisting  though  decreasing margin  of slack  in  resource utilization

was  expected  to  be  associated  with  further  slowing  in  wage  and  price

inflation.

In  the  Committee's  discussion  of  economic  and  financial

developments  and the  outlook  for  the  economy,  the members  agreed  that

a sustained  expansion  at  a moderate pace  remained  the  most  reasonable

expectation  and  that  such  an  expansion was  likely to  be  associated

with  further  easing of  inflation.  They noted  that  considerable

progress  had been made  in  correcting major  structural  imbalances  and

financial  problems  in  various  sectors  of  the  economy  and that  business

and  consumer  confidence  had  improved appreciably  since  the  turn  of  the

year.  However,  the most  recent  information  suggested  some weakening

in  the  expansion,  and  a number  of  members  expressed  concern  about  the

apparent  absence  of  cumulating  or  self-reinforcing  improvement  in

overall  economic  activity.  Sluggish  growth  of  jobs  and  income,

ongoing  efforts  to  strengthen balance  sheets,  and  in  the  view of a

number  of  members  the weakness  in  broad  measures  of  money and  credit

suggested  that  the  risks  to  the  economy were  more  heavily weighted  to

the  downside.  Others  felt  that  the  expansion was  now more  firmly

entrenched and  that  the risks  were more  evenly balanced;  some  of  these

members  noted,  however,  that  given the  likely restrained  pace  of  the

expansion, a significant  shortfall  from their  current  projections

could  have  more worrisome  effects  than  the  limited  inflationary

pressures  that  might be  fostered  by  a somewhat  stronger-than-projected

economy.  With  regard  to  the  outlook  for  inflation, the members  were

encouraged  by  indications  of  moderating price and  labor  cost

pressures.  Most  believed  that  additional  progress  toward  price

stability  was  likely  over  the  next  several  quarters  in  the  context  of

some  persisting  slack in  labor  and  other  production  resources  and

after  an  extended  period  of  slow  growth  in  key measures  of  money.

In  keeping with  the  practice  at  meetings  when  the Committee

sets  its  long-run  ranges  for  the  money and  debt  aggregates,  the

members  of  the Committee  and  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank presidents not

currently  serving  as  members  provided  specific  projections  of  the

growth  in  nominal  and  real  GDP,  the  rate  of  unemployment,  and  the  rate

of  inflation  for  the years  1992  and  1993.  These projections  took

account  of  the monetary  growth  ranges  that  the Committee  reaffirmed  at

this  meeting for  1992  and  established  on  a tentative  basis  for  1993;

these  ranges  were  expected  to  be  consistent with  the  Committee's  goals

of promoting a  sustained  expansion  in  the  economy and  continued

progress  toward  price  stability.  The  projections  generally  portrayed

an  economy performing  in  line with  these  objectives--that  is,  with

expansion  at  a moderate  pace  over  the next  1-1/2  years  and  inflation

slowing gradually  further.  Forecasts  of  nominal  GDP  converged  on

growth  ranges  of  5-1/4  to  6 percent  for  1992  as  a whole  and  5-1/2  to

6-1/4  percent  for  1993.  With  regard  to  the  rate  of  expansion  in real

GDP,  the  projections  had  a central  tendency  of  2-1/4  to  2-3/4  percent

for  1992  and  of  2-3/4  to  3 percent  for  1993,  implying  a  gradual

acceleration  from the  pace  currently  estimated  for  the  first  half  of

this  year.  The  projected  strengthening  of  the  economy was  associated

with  some  decline  in the  rate  of  civilian unemployment to  a  consensus

range  of  6-1/2  to  7 percent  by  the  fourth  quarter  of  1993.  Given  the

moderate  expansion  of  the  economy  and  the  still  relatively  elevated

level  of the  unemployment  rate,  the  rate  of  inflation,  as  measured  by

the  consumer  price  index, was  projected  to  move  somewhat  lower;  the

central  tendency  of  the  range  expected  for  1993  was  2-3/4  to  3-1/4

percent.

Members  observed  that  developments  relating  to  the  financial

condition  of  households  and  businesses were  likely to  continue  to  have

an  important  influence  on  economic  activity  over  the  quarters  ahead.

Widespread  efforts  to  strengthen  balance  sheets  along with conserva-

tive  lending policies  at  financial  intermediaries had  exerted  a

significantly  retarding effect  on  economic  activity  by  diverting cash

flows  from  consumer and  investment  expenditures  or  limiting  the  avail-

ability  of  financing for  current  spending.  However,  while  the  process

of  adjusting balance  sheets  was  still  incomplete  and  was  still

restraining  business  and  consumer  spending,  the  combination  of  greatly

reduced  interest  rates  and  strengthened  balance  sheets  pointed  to

subsiding constraints  on  expenditures  from financial  factors.  At  the

same time,  lending  institutions  now appeared  to  be  in  a better

position  to  accommodate  borrowers.  Indeed,  anecdotal  reports  from

several  parts  of the  country indicated  that many  banking institutions

were  intensifying  their  efforts  to  make  loans,  though  loan  demand

remained  quite  limited.  Members  also  observed that  corporate  cash

flows  and  profits were much  improved.

In  their  review of  economic  conditions  and  business  and

consumer  attitudes  in  different  regions,  members  reported  that  gradual

expansion  characterized  most  parts  of  the  nation, though they  cited

some  significant exceptions  and  also  noted that  on  the whole recent

indicators  pointed to  less  strength than  early  in the year.  Business

and  consumer  sentiment, while  considerably  improved  since  late  last

year,  nonetheless  remained  quite  cautious  and  seemed  vulnerable to

adverse developments.  Consumers were  still  very  concerned  about

employment  opportunities,  while business  executives were  reluctant  to

make  investment  commitments  or  to  build  inventories  in  the  absence  of

firmer  indications  of  a significant  pickup  in  demand.

With  regard  to  developments  in  major  sectors  of  the  economy,

members  generally viewed  some pickup  in  consumer  spending  from its

recently  sluggish pace  as  a likely  development that  in  turn would

provide  ongoing support  to  the  expansion.  An  essential  element  in

sustaining consumer  expenditures,  and  thus  the  economy more  generally,

would be  the  growth  in  job  opportunities  and  personal  incomes.  While

heavy  debt-service  burdens  and  reduced  interest  incomes,  among  other

factors,  continued  to  curb  the  ability or  willingness  of  many

consumers  to  increase their  spending,  some  tentative  indications  of  a

firming trend  in  such  spending  could  be  drawn  from the  signs  of

reviving consumer  confidence  and  anecdotal  reports  suggesting  that

-10-

consumer  spending was  growing  at  least modestly  in  many  areas.  In

particular,  demands  for motor  vehicles had  strengthened,  and the

related  step-up  in  the  production  of  automotive  products had  accounted

for  much  of  the  growth  in  industrial  production  over  recent months.

With  regard to  the  outlook  for housing,  residential  construction had

weakened  in  many parts  of the  country,  though  it  was  holling up  well

in  some  areas.  The  backup  in  mortgage rates  earlier  in  the  year had

reinforced the  more general  cautionary factors  that  had  tended  to

inhibit  overall  spending.  However,  mortgage  rates  had  fallen

substantially  over  the  spring,  and  the members  expected housing

activity  to  pick  up  somewhat  over  the  quarters ahead.

Despite  still  cautious  business  attitudes, moderate  growth

in  overall  business  fixed  investment was  anticipated  over  the  forecast

period.  Spending  could  be buoyed  by  demands  for  business  equipment,

much  of  which probably would  be related  to  efforts  to  modernize

production  facilities  for  competitive  reasons.  Rising  rates  of

capacity utilization  also  could  be  expected  to spur  investment  demand

as  time  went  on.  The  outlook  for  nonresidential  construction was more

negative.  Office  construction  appeared  likely to  remain  severely

depressed for  an  extended period  as  excess  capacity  was absorbed  in

many parts  of  the  country.  On the more  positive  side,  anecdotal

impressions  from several  cities  suggested  that  prices  and  lease terms

of  office  and  other  commercial  structures were tending to  stabilize,

though  the volume  of  actual transactions  remained  quite  limited.

The government  and  foreign  trade  sectors  also  were not  seen

as  likely  to  contribute  significantly  to  the expansion.  The wide-

spread  financial  problems  of  state  and  local  governments  pointed to

quite  limited  growth  in  spending,  even  though  examples  of  sizable

expenditure  programs,  such  as  for  highway  construction  in  some  areas,

-11-

could  be  cited.  At  the federal  level,  defense  spending was  on  a clear

downtrend,  and the  persistence of  large  federal  deficits  argued

against  sizable  new initiatives  for  nondefense  spending.  With regard

to  the  external  sector,  a number  of  members  expressed  the view that

the  outlook for  net  exports  had worsened  despite the weakening  in  the

foreign  exchange  value  of  the  dollar  in  recent  months.  The  growth  in

exports  appeared  to  be  moderating, and  it  was  uncertain at  this  point

to what  extent  economic  expansion  abroad  might  strengthen and  thereby

produce  increased  demand for  U.  S.  goods  and  services.  At  the  same

time,  domestic  expansion in  line  with  the members'  forecasts would  add

to  the  demand  for  imports.

Most  members  anticipated  at  least  a limited  decline  in  the

core  rate  of  inflation  over  the  period through  the  end  of  next year.

In  support  of  this  view, some  members  emphasized the  lagged  effects  of

the  very  restrained  growth  in  money over  a long  period  while others

gave more  weight  to  the  outlook for  continuing if  diminishing  slack  in

labor  and  other  production  inputs.  In  addition,  business  executives

reported  that  strong  competition  still  was  making it  very  difficult

to  raise  prices  and  that  continuing efforts  were  being made  to  improve

operating efficiencies  and  hold  down  costs.  At  the  same  time,  surveys

of  price  expectations  and  conversations with  business contacts

suggested  a view, rooted  partly in  concerns  about  the prospects  for

and  implications  of  further  large  federal  deficits,  that  inflation

ultimately would  return to  the  4 to  5 percent  pace  of  the 1980s.

These  attitudes tended  to  underscore  the  need  for a sound  fiscal

policy that  in  conjunction with  the  continued  implementation  of  an

anti-inflationary monetary  policy would  foster  a reduction  in

inflationary  expectations  and would  facilitate the eventual

achievement  of  price  stability.

-12-

In  keeping with  the  requirements  of  the Full  Employment  and

Balanced  Growth Act  of  1978  (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act),  the  Committee

at  this  meeting  reviewed the  ranges  for  growth  in the monetary  and

debt  aggregates that  it  had  established  in  February  for  1992  and

decided  on  tentative  ranges for  growth  in  those aggregates  in  1993.

The  current  ranges  for  the  period  from the fourth  quarter  of  1991  to

the  fourth  quarter  of  1992  included  expansion  of  2-1/2  to  6-1/2

percent  for  M2  and  1 to  5 percent  for  M3.  The monitoring  range for

growth  of  total  domestic nonfinancial debt  had  been  set  at  4-1/2  to

8-1/2  percent.

In  the  course  of  the Committee's  discussion,  all  of  the

members  supported  a proposal  to  retain  the  ranges  established  in

February  for  this  year.  Although  the  rates  of  M2  and  M3  growth  for

the  year through  June were  somewhat  below the  lower  ends  of  the

Committee's  ranges  for  both  aggregates,  this  outcome  had  not  been

associated with  unexpected weakness  in  nominal  spending;  the expansion

in  nominal  GDP  over  the  first  half  of  the year  currently was  estimated

to have  been toward  the upper  end  of  the  central  tendency  of  the

members'  earlier  expectations.  Instead,  velocity had  risen

appreciably--a highly unusual  occurrence  following  a period  of  sharp

declines  in  interest  rates.  Among the developments  helping to  explain

the  weakness  in  money and  the  rise  in  velocity were  a variety  of

business  and  balance  sheet  pressures  that  tended  to  reduce  total

borrowing  and  channel  credit  flows  away  from depository  institutions,

thereby  lessening  the  need  of  those  institutions  to  increase their

monetary liabilities.  At  the  same time,  business  firms  and

households,  in  the  course  of  their  restructuring  activities  and

deleveraging of  their  balance  sheets,  had  found  that  monetary  assets

-13-

had  become  less  attractive  relative to  a variety  of  other  financial

assets  or  debt  repayment.

It  appeared  that  the balance  sheet  adjustments  by  depository

institutions  and  their  customers  that  had contributed  to  velocity

increases were well  under way.  However,  the  factors that  were tending

to  depress broad  money  growth  in  relation to  measures  of  economic  and

price performance were  likely  to  persist,  and  the  extent and  duration

of  deviations  from historic  relationships  were highly uncertain.  In

these  circumstances,  while an  argument  could  be made that  a somewhat

lower  M2  range  might more  readily  encompass  the  rate  of  expansion  in

money  needed  for  a  satisfactory economic  performance  over  the balance

of  the  year,  the selection  of  a different range would  imply  greater

certainty about  emerging  relationships  than was  warranted.  Instead,

the  current  ranges  should be  maintained,  pending  further  developments

and  the  possible  emergence of  a more  settled  outlook  for  money demand.

Some  members  also  commented that  lowering the  ranges  could  be

misconstrued  as  an  intention to  tighten  monetary policy  at  a time  when

relatively  sluggish  growth  in  the  economy and  weakness  in  the monetary

aggregates  argued  for  a  steady policy  course  or  possibly for  some

easing.

At  the  conclusion  of  this  discussion,  the Committee  voted to

reaffirm the  1992  ranges  of  2-1/2  to  6-1/2  percent  and  1 to  5 percent

that  it  had  established  in  February  for  growth  of  M2  and M3,

respectively;  the  Committee  also  decided  to  retain  the  range  of  4-1/2

to  8-1/2  percent  for  growth  of  nonfinancial  debt  in  1992.  The

following  statement  was  approved  for  inclusion  in  the Committee's

domestic  policy  directive:

The Federal  Open Market  Committee  seeks

monetary and  financial conditions  that  will foster
price  stability and  promote  sustainable  growth  in
output.  In  furtherance  of  these  objectives, the

-14-

Committee  reaffirmed  at  this  meeting the  ranges  it
had  established  in February  for  growth  of  M2  and M3
of  2-1/2  to  6-1/2  percent  and  1 to  5 percent,
respectively, measured  from the fourth  quarter  of
1991  to  the fourth  quarter  of  1992.  The  Committee
anticipated  that  developments  contributing to
unusual  velocity  increases  could persist  in the
second  half  of the year.  The monitoring  range  for
growth  of  total  domestic  nonfinancial debt  also  was
maintained  at  4-1/2  to  8-1/2  percent  for  the year.

Votes  for  this  action:  Messrs.  Greenspan,

Corrigan,  Angell,  Hoenig,  Jordan, Kelley, LaWare,
Lindsey,  Melzer,  Mullins,  Ms.  Phillips,  and
Mr.  Syron.

Votes  against  this  action:  None.

With  regard to  the  ranges  for  1993  to  be  established  on  a

tentative  basis  at  this meeting,  a majority  of  the members  endorsed  an

extension  of  the  current  ranges  for  another  year,  but  some  believed

that  a  somewhat  lower  range  for  M2  would  be  preferable.  Members  who

wanted  to  retain  the current  ranges  acknowledged  that  a  lower  M2  range

probably would  be  desirable at  some  point to  be  consistent  over  time

with the  Committee's  objective  of  achieving  and  maintaining  reasonable

price stability.  However,  current  uncertainties  with  regard  to  how

soon  and  to what  extent  various  factors  tending to  inhibit  the  growth

in  M2 would  dissipate  argued  for  caution  in  making any  change  to  the

range  now.  A reduction  in  the M2  range  could  be  considered  next

February when  the  Committee meets  to  set  final  ranges  for  money  growth

for  1993,  or  the  range  could  be  lowered  even  sooner  if  new  information

on  the  emerging  relationship  between  the monetary  aggregates  and

nominal  spending allowed  a determination  of  the  appropriate  range  to

be made  with more  confidence.

Members  who  preferred  a somewhat  lower  M2  range  for  1993

acknowledged  that  substantial uncertainties  with  regard  to  an

appropriate  rate  of M2  growth were  likely  to  persist  for  some  time,

but  they felt  that  relatively  subdued  monetary  expansion was  likely  to

-15-

be  consistent with  an  adequate  degree  of  liquidity  and  a satisfactory

economic  performance  next  year.  Lowering  the M2  range  at  this  point

would  extend the  series  of  gradual reductions  in  the ranges  that had

been  implemented  over  the  last  five years  or  so  and  would have  the

important  advantage  of  affirming the  Committee's  commitment  to  price

stability, with  favorable  implications  for  inflationary  expectations

and  in  turn  perhaps  also for  the  strength  and  sustainability  of the

expansion.  A  few members  favoring this  option were  also  of  the view

that  more weight  ought  to  be  placed on M2  as  a  guide to  policy;  this

would have  possible  implications  for  actions  to  boost  M2  growth in

1992  in  addition to  reducing the  range  for  1993  to  promote  long-run

disinflation.  All  of  the  members  agreed  that  regardless  of  the

particulars  of  the  decisions  to  be made  at  this  meeting,  it  was  vital

for  the  Committee to  reaffirm its  commitment  to  the  goal  of  achieving

price  stability.  This  outcome  was the  key contribution  the  Federal

Reserve  could make  toward  facilitating the highest  possible growth  of

the  economy  over  time;  and  maintaining the credibility  of  the  System's

anti-inflationary  effort was  the  best  means  available to  the  Committee

to minimize  disruptions to  the  economy  as  it  was  moving toward  its

potential.

At  the  conclusion  of  this  discussion,  the Committee  approved

provisional  ranges  for  1993  that  were  unchanged  from those for  1992.

The  Committee  voted  to  incorporate the  following  statement  regarding

the  1993  ranges  in  its  domestic  policy  directive:

For  1993,  the  Committee  on  a tentative basis  set

the  same  ranges  as  in  1992  for  growth  of  the monetary
aggregates  and  debt,  measured  from the  fourth  quarter
of  1992  to  the  fourth  quarter  of  1993.  The behavior  of
the monetary  aggregates  will  continue  to be  evaluated
in  the  light  of  progress toward  price  level  stability,
movements  in  their  velocities,  and  developments  in  the
economy  and  financial markets.

-16-

Votes  for  this  action:  Messrs.  Greenspan,

Corrigan,  Angell,  Hoenig, Kelley, LaWare,
Lindsey,  Melzer,  Mullins,  and  Mr.  Syron.

Votes  against  this  action:  Mr.  Jordan

and  Ms.  Phillips.

Mr.  Jordan  and  Ms.  Phillips  dissented  because  they believed

that  a  somewhat  lower  M2  range  for  1993  would  be  more  consistent with

a policy  of  continuing progress  toward  price  stability.  They

recognized  that  the  substantial  uncertainties  surrounding the  outlook

for  M2  growth  and  its  velocity next  year  made  it  very  difficult  to

determine  an  appropriate M2  range,  but  a  lower  range would  be  needed

eventually to  achieve  and  sustain  stable prices.  In  the  interim,  it

was  important  for  the  System and  the  credibility  of  its  anti-

inflationary policy  to  continue  the practice  of  gradually  reducing  the

M2  range  to  be  consistent  with  a noninflationary  target.  They would

have  coupled the  decrease  in  the  range  for  1993  with  actions  to  expand

bank  reserves  immediately with the  objective  of  boosting M2  growth  to

within  its  range for  1992.  Such  a combination  would make  clear  that

the  decrease  in  the  range  for M2  growth  in  1993  did  not  represent  a

monetary  "tightening" in  the  conventional  sense,  but  rather  that  it

was  a step  toward  lasting  reductions  in  inflation.

Turning  to  policy  for  the  intermeeting period  ahead,  the

members  were  divided between  those who  supported  an  unchanged  policy

stance  and  others who  preferred  to  ease.  A majority  indicated,

however,  that  they could  support  an unchanged  directive  that

incorporated  a  bias toward  possible  easing.

Members  who  preferred not  to  change  policy  at  this  point

believed  that  the  economy  was  on  a moderate  growth  path  and  that  in

any  case  the forces  restraining the  expansion  were not  the  result  of

inadequate  liquidity  or  a  restrictive monetary  policy.  While  the

-17-

outlook was  clouded by  unusual forces  acting  on  the  economy,  the

available economic  information  remained  consistent with  continuing

expansion  at  a pace  that  offered favorable  prospects  for  a gradual

reduction  of unemployment  and  abatement  of  inflation.  The  low level

of  real  and  nominal  short-term interest  rates,  the  decline  in  the

dollar,  and  the  rapid  growth  of  reserves  and  narrow money along with

the  expansion  of  bond mutual  funds--which while  not  in  M2  seemed  to

provide  liquidity  at  least  comparable  to  that  of  time  deposits--

suggested that  monetary policy had  been  quite  accommodative.  Some

members who  supported this  view expressed  concern  that  in  the  absence

of  more  definitive indications  of  a softening  economy or  much  greater

weakness  in  the monetary aggregates,  any easing  at  this  point would

tend  to  erode  the  credibility  of  the  Committee's  commitment  to  an

anti-inflationary  policy.  The  result  might well  be  to  put  substantial

and  disruptive  downward  pressure  on  the  dollar  in  foreign  exchange

markets  and  to  arrest  or  reverse the  tendency for  domestic  long-term

interest  rates  to  decline.

Most  of  the members who  preferred  an  immediate  easing of

policy  emphasized  the  risks  of a faltering economy  in  the  period

ahead,  especially given  the  recent  indications  of  some slowing  in  the

expansion and  the  already  considerable  slack in  the  economy.  Their

concerns  were heightened  by the  constraining effects  of  ongoing

structural  adjustments  in  the  economy, the weakness in  various

measures  of  money,  and  the  limited  expansion  in  total credit.  A few

of  these members  focused  on the desirability  of  taking relatively

prompt  action  to  foster  growth  in  the  broad measures  of  money within

the  Committee's  ranges  for  the  year.  Some members  observed that  under

current  circumstances  an  easing action  might have  a relatively  limited

effect  in  stimulating monetary growth  over  the months  ahead,  but  such

-18-

a policy move would  nonetheless tend  to  boost  spending by  reducing  the

costs  of  borrowing.

In  their  discussion, the members took  account  of  a staff

analysis  that  suggested  only modest  growth  in M2  and  virtually  none  in

M3  for  the third  quarter  on  the assumption  of  an unchanged  degree  of

reserve  pressure.  Relatively weak  expansion  in  these broad  measures

of money did  not appear  to have  the usual  implications  for the

economy,  as  evidenced  by  experience over  the  first half  of  the  year.

The  prospects were  for  continuing balance sheet  and  other  adjustments

that would  tend  to  curb  the demand for  money  assets  relative to

spending and  income.  Many members  nonetheless were  concerned  about

the  possible persistence  of  the  recent weakness  in  reserves  and  the

longer-term sluggish behavior  of  broad money,  especially  given the

relatively  subdued pace  of  the  expansion.  While monetary measures

might  well  have  lost  some  of  their  indicator  and  predictive

properties,  continued weakness  in  money  might  still  be  a signal  that

financial  conditions were not  yet  conducive  to  fostering  a sustained

pickup  in  spending.

The varying  policy preferences  expressed by the members were

reflected  in  differing  views  with  regard  to  possible adjustments to

the degree  of  reserve pressure in  the  intermeeting  period  ahead.  All

of the members who  favored  some  immediate  easing in  policy  indicated

that  they  could  support  an  unchanged  directive  that was  tilted  toward

ease,  and  at  least  some  of  these  members anticipated  that  developments

over  the near  term were  likely to trigger  an  adjustment toward  easing.

Most  of  the members who  favored  an  unchanged  policy  stance  at  this

point  also  indicated  that they  could  accept  a bias  toward  ease in  the

directive,  especially  in  light  of  current uncertainties  and the

potential  problems  associated with  any  significant  shortfall  in  the

-19-

expansion  from current  expectations.  Other  members who  preferred  a

steady policy course  believed that  it would  be  premature  for  the

Committee to  signal  any bias  toward  easing,  given the relatively low

probability that  they assigned  to  the potential  need  for  such  a move,

and they believed  that  a return  to an  asymmetric  directive  after  the

move  to  symmetry  at  the May meeting  could  have unfavorable  reper-

cussions  on the  Committee's  credibility.

At  the  conclusion  of the  Committee's  discussion,  all  but  two

of  the  members  indicated that  they favored  or  could  accept  a directive

that  called  for maintaining  the existing  degree  of  pressure  on  reserve

positions  and that  included  a bias  toward  possible  easing during the

intermeeting period.  Accordingly,  in  the  context of  the Committee's

long-run objectives  for  price  stability  and  sustainable  economic

growth,  and  giving  careful consideration  to  economic,  financial, and

monetary developments,  slightly  greater  reserve restraint  might  be

acceptable  or  slightly  lesser  reserve  restraint  would be  acceptable

during  the intermeeting period.  The  reserve  conditions  contemplated

at  this  meeting were  expected  to  be  consistent with  a resumption  of

growth  in  M2  and  M3  at  annual  rates  of  about  2 percent  and  1/2  percent

respectively  over  the three-month  period  from June  through  September.

At  the  conclusion  of the  meeting the following  domestic

policy  directive was  issued to  the  Federal Reserve  Bank  of  New York:

The information  reviewed  at  this  meeting continues

to  suggest  that  economic  activity  is  expanding  at  a
moderate  pace.  Total nonfarm payroll  employment
increased  somewhat  further in  May, but  a surge  in  job
seekers  led  to  a sizable rise  in  the  civilian unemploy-
ment  rate to  7.5  percent.  Industrial production  rose
appreciably  further in  May,  partly reflecting continued
recovery  in  motor  vehicle  assemblies.  Growth  in
consumer  spending  has  slackened  after  a sharp  advance
earlier  this  year.  Although  sales  of  new homes
declined  in  May,  single-family housing  starts  rebounded
to  a level  close  to  the  first-quarter pace.  Recent
data  on  orders  and  shipments  of nondefense  capital
goods  indicate  appreciable  increases  in  outlays  for

-20-

business  equipment,  and the  trend  of building  contracts
points  to  some  slowing  of  the decline  in nonresidential
construction.  The nominal  U.S. merchandise  trade
deficit  increased in  April  and was  substantially above
its  average  rate  in the  first  quarter.  Incoming data
on  retail prices  and  labor  costs  suggest  that  inflation
is  slowing.

Most  interest  rates  have  changed  little  since the

Committee  meeting  on May  19.  In  foreign  exchange
markets,  the trade-weighted  value  of  the  dollar  in
terms  of the  other G-10  currencies  declined  further
over  the  intermeeting period.

M2  and  M3  changed  little  in  May  and  appear  to  have

contracted  in  June;  both  retail and  large-denomination
time deposits  continued  to  run  off  rapidly.  Through
June,  expansion  of the  two aggregates was  somewhat
below  the  lower  ends  of the  ranges  established  by the
Committee  for  the year.

The  Federal  Open Market  Committee  seeks  monetary

and  financial  conditions that will  foster  price  sta-
bility  and  promote  sustainable  growth  in  output.  In
furtherance  of  these  objectives,  the  Committee  re-
affirmed  at  this  meeting the  ranges  it  had established
in  February  for  growth  of  M2  and  M3  of  2-1/2  to  6-1/2
percent  and  1 to  5 percent  respectively, measured from
the  fourth  quarter  of  1991  to  the fourth  quarter  of
1992.  The Committee  anticipated that  developments  con-
tributing to  unusual velocity  increases  could  persist
in  the  second  half  of  the  year.  The  monitoring  range
for  growth  of  total  domestic  nonfinancial  debt  also  was
maintained  at  4-1/2  to  8-1/2  percent  for  the year.  For
1993,  the  Committee  on  a tentative  basis  set  the  same
ranges  as  in  1992  for  growth  of  the monetary  aggregates
and  debt,  measured  from the  fourth  quarter  of  1992  to
the  fourth  quarter  of  1993.  The behavior  of  the
monetary  aggregates will  continue  to  be  evaluated  in
the  light  of  progress  toward  price  level  stability,
movements  in  their  velocities,  and  developments  in  the
economy  and  financial  markets.

In  the  implementation of  policy  for  the  immediate

future,  the Committee  seeks  to  maintain the  existing
degree  of  pressure on  reserve  positions.  In  the
context  of  the  Committee's  long-run  objectives  for
price  stability and  sustainable  economic  growth,  and
giving  careful  consideration  to  economic,  financial,
and  monetary  developments,  slightly greater  reserve
restraint  might  or  slightly lesser  reserve  restraint
would  be  acceptable  in  the  intermeeting period.  The
contemplated  reserve  conditions  are  expected  to  be

-21-

consistent  with growth  of M2  and M3  over  the  period
from June  through  September  at  annual  rates  of  about
2 and  1/2  percent,  respectively.

Votes  for  short-run  policy:  Messrs.  Greenspan,

Corrigan, Angell, Hoenig,  Jordan, Kelley, Lindsey,
Mullins,  Ms.  Phillips,  and  Mr.  Syron.

Votes  against  this  action:  Messrs.  LaWare

and  Melzer.

Messrs.  LaWare  and Melzer  dissented  because they  judged  an

asymmetric  directive, with  a bias  toward  easing,  as  being inappro-

priate  at  this  time.  In  their  view, the  current  stance  of  monetary

policy was  not  impeding  an  expansion  consistent  with the  economy's

long-run potential.  In  addition,  a bias  toward  ease,  especially in

the  context  of  the  Committee's  decision  at  the May meeting  to  adopt  a

symmetrical  directive,  suggested  an  excessive  emphasis  on  short-term

economic  developments  that  might  undermine  the credibility of  the

System's  long-run policies.  They were  concerned  that  such  a loss  of

credibility  could  have  adverse  effects  on  the dollar  in  foreign

exchange markets  and  on  long-term interest  rates  in  domestic  markets.

Mr.  Melzer  also  believed that,  if  additional  easing were  undertaken,

a greater  policy  reversal ultimately would be  necessary,  making the

attainment  of  sustainable economic  growth more  difficult  in  the  long

run.

Attachment

RECORD  OF POLICY ACTIONS  OF THE

FEDERAL OPEN MARKET  COMMITTEE

Meeting Held on July 2-3,  1991

Domestic policy  directive

The  information reviewed at  this  meeting suggested  that  an

upturn  in economic  activity had begun  in recent months.  Sizable gains

in consumer  spending and small  increases  in expenditures  on residential

construction appeared to be  fueling a moderate  rise  in domestic final

demand.  Although inventories  were  still  being liquidated, data for

industrial  production and  labor markets indicated that output  was  being

stepped up to meet  that  demand.  Excluding  food and energy  items,

increases  in consumer prices  had been small  in  recent  months.

Total nonfarm payroll employment  edged up  in May, following

nearly a year of  uninterrupted declines,  and the average workweek posted

a sizable gain.  The  turnaround in employment  in May was  fairly  broad-

based.  In manufacturing, recalls  of  workers  in  the motor  vehicles

industry more than accounted  for the  overall  increase, but  most  other

manufacturing industries registered  either small  job  gains  or greatly

moderated job  losses.  Employment  also turned  up in the  construction

sector and in  private  service-producing  industries.  The  unemployment

rate  rose to  6.9  percent  in May but,  averaged over  April and May, the

unemployment  rate was  little  changed  from its  March level.

Industrial production rose  in April and May, after declining

sharply earlier in  the  year;  the  limited product  data  available  for  June

pointed toward another gain.  Perhaps  reflecting the  pickup in housing

starts  in recent months,  production of  construction  supplies  turned  up

in April  and May.  Further advances  in  assemblies  of motor vehicles

contributed  to a slight  rise in manufacturing output over the two

months;  in  spite  of the  overall  increase  in activity, though, the

operating rate in manufacturing edged lower  in May and remained  well

below its  level  of a year earlier.

Real personal  consumption expenditures  rebounded in May from an

April decline;  over the March-to-May period, the  rise in outlays  out-

paced gains  in personal  income.  In  May, a sizable  increase  in spending

for  durable goods  reflected  stronger outlays  for motor vehicles  and

higher expenditures  for most major categories  of nondurable goods.  Ex-

cluding outlays  for electricity  associated with unusually warm weather,

spending for  services  increased  only modestly in May.  Continuing a

pattern of gradual  recovery recorded  in earlier months,  housing starts

rose  over April  and May.  In  these two months,  single-family  starts

strengthened further  but, with apartment vacancy rates  continuing high,

multifamily construction  remained quite  weak.

After declining in the  first  quarter of the  year,  shipments of

nondefense capital  goods  increased in both April and May.  The  turn-

around resulted mostly  from larger shipments of aircraft;  shipments  of

other types  of business  equipment increased  slightly over  the  two

months.  Recent  data  on orders  pointed to  some firming in  the demand for

business equipment.  Near-record vacancy  rates  for  office buildings  and

above-average vacancy  rates  for  industrial buildings  suggested  continu-

ing  weakness  in nonresidential  construction,  although a small  increase

was  recorded  in April.  The pace of  liquidation of manufacturing and

trade  inventories  slowed in April  from the  very rapid March rate,

largely reflecting a slower  rate  of reduction  in stocks  at  auto dealers.

-3-

In May, manufacturing  inventories  fell  appreciably further,  with draw-

downs  occurring in most durable  and nondurable  categories.  For most

industries, the  sharp inventory  corrections of  recent months  along with

a pickup  in  sales  have  reduced inventory-to-sales ratios  substantially.

In  April, the preliminary nominal  U.S. merchandise trade

deficit  widened slightly  from the  revised March level;  however, the

April  deficit  was  somewhat  smaller than the  average  for the  first

quarter,  which itself had registered a sizable decrease.  The  value of

both exports  and  imports  rose in  April.  For  exports,  the  increase

occurred primarily  in capital  goods and automotive  products,  but  gains

also  were  indicated for  a broad range  of  industrial  supplies.  Increases

in  the value  of  imports  were  spread among capital  and consumer goods  and

non-oil  industrial  supplies.  Recent  indicators of  economic activity in

the major  foreign industrial  countries  had been mixed;  on balance,

growth seemed to  have been  sluggish in  the  second  quarter, while infla-

tion  in most of  these countries appeared to be  stable or  declining.

Nonfood, non-energy consumer prices  increased over  the March

through May period at  a substantially slower pace than over  the  first

two  months  of the  year.  Part  of the  slowdown in recent  months  reflected

an unwinding  of  large price  increases  that had occurred in  certain com-

ponents  of  the  index  early in  the  year.  In May, producer prices  of

finished goods  firmed somewhat,  largely  reflecting an  upturn in  energy

prices.  Although average  hourly earnings  of production  or  nonsuper-

visory workers  rose  at  a faster  rate  in April and May than  in  the  first

quarter of the year, the  increase  in  earnings  over the  twelve months

ending in May slowed  somewhat.  For the twelve months  ending in March,

-4-

growth  in total employer  costs  for  compensation of  private  industry

workers  had slowed  from the  comparable  year-earlier period.

At  its  meeting on May 14,  1991,  the Committee  adopted  a direc-

tive that  called for maintaining the  existing degree  of  pressure  on

reserve positions  and that  did not  contain any presumption about  the

likely  direction of  possible  intermeeting adjustments.  Accordingly, the

directive  indicated that  somewhat more  or  somewhat  less pressure  on

reserve positions might be  appropriate during the  intermeeting period

depending on progress  toward price stability, trends  in  economic

activity, the behavior of  the monetary aggregates,  and developments  in

foreign exchange  and domestic  financial markets.  The  contemplated

reserve  conditions were expected to  be  consistent with  growth of  M2  and

M3 at  annual  rates  of  around  4 and  2 percent  respectively over the

three-month period  from March through  June.

Open market  operations  during the  intermeeting period were

directed toward maintaining the existing  degree  of pressure  on  reserve

positions.  The  federal  funds  rate  remained near  5-3/4  percent,  while

adjustment plus  seasonal borrowing tended to  average  a little  above

assumed levels  because  of  somewhat  greater usage  of  adjustment  credit.

Several technical  changes  were made  to  assumed levels  of  borrowing to

reflect  expected  increases  in the  demand for  seasonal  credit  during the

spring crop  planting  season.  Against  a backdrop of  accumulating evi-

dence  that  the  economy was  beginning to recover  and related expectations

that  no  further easing of monetary policy was  likely  in  the near  term,

many interest  rates  rose  slightly during the  intermeeting period,  while

most major  stock  price  indexes edged higher  on  balance.

-5-

The trade-weighted value  of the  dollar in  terms  of the other

G-10  currencies  increased substantially on  net  over the  intermeeting

period, partly  in  response to  news  suggesting that  the  U.S.  economy was

turning upward.  The dollar  rose  strongly against  the mark  and other

European  currencies,  which also were  affected by political  developments

in Europe.

Growth of  M2  rebounded in May from its  tax-related weakness  in

April but  slowed  again in  June.  Over  the  three months  ending with June,

the  expansion of  M2  fell  somewhat  short  of  Committee  expectations.  In-

flows  to the  liquid retail deposit  components  of M2 were  strong in  the

latest two months,  but  small time  deposits  declined at  an  accelerating

rate;  depositors  evidently responded to  less  attractive  offering rates

on  these deposits  by  shifting  some  funds  not  only  into  liquid money

stock  components but  also  into bond and  stock  mutual  funds  and  other

capital market  investments  not  included  in this  aggregate.  M3  fell

slightly in  June  and had grown  little  since  February,  reflecting con-

tinued  shrinkage  of  the  thrift  industry and  the  weakness  in bank  loan

demand and therefore  in  overall  funding needs.  For the  year thus  far,

expansion of M2  and M3  had been  in the middle  portion of  the Committee's

ranges.

The  staff  projection prepared  for  this meeting  suggested that

economic  activity was  beginning to  recover from the  recession and  that

moderate  growth in  final  demand accompanied by  a shift  in  business  in-

ventories  from substantial  liquidation  to modest  accumulation would lead

to  considerable  growth over  the  second half  of the  year.  The  stimulus

from the  inventory swing  was projected  to  diminish next year  and the

-6-

expansion to  slow gradually to a pace  consistent with continuing

moderate growth in final  demand.  On balance, the early and  subsequent

phases  of  the recovery were projected to be  relatively slow by past

cyclical  standards,  reflecting the  limited impetus  that  could be

expected from some key  sectors of  the  economy, such as  nonresidential

construction  where activity  would be  depressed by high  vacancy rates.

In addition, fiscal policy, including the budgetary stance of  state  and

local  governments, was projected to remain  fairly restrictive.  Against

the  background of continuing,  albeit decreasing, slack in  labor and

product markets, the  core  rate of  inflation was  expected to decline

considerably over the  period through the end of  1992.

In the Committee's  review of current  and  prospective economic

developments,  the members  generally agreed that  a recovery very likely

was under way, that  final  demand would grow moderately  for  some time,

and that  an  end to inventory  reductions would provide  an impetus  to

production over  coming quarters.  A number of  factors  were  expected to

damp the expansion, notably the  budget policies  of  governments  at  all

levels and  continuing weakness  in nonresidental  construction.  There

also  were puzzling aspects  to the  current  situation and  attendant  risks

to  the  outlook:  commodity prices had  failed to  firm in their  usual

pattern in the  early  stages of  a recovery;  on  the  financial  side, money

and  credit growth had remained modest,  and conditions  were  still  fragile

in many  respects.  However,  sources of  strength  in an  economic  expansion

often have been difficult to anticipate  near a cycle  trough.  Moreover,

while  the expansion was  expected to  be  slower than the  average  in post-

war business  cycles,  the recession  had been relatively  shallow, and  a

-7-

moderate expansion was more  likely to be sustained  for a considerable

period ahead,  in  large measure because it  would be  consistent with

containing inflation pressures.

The  members  projected  that  the  underlying  rate  of  inflation

would decline in  coming quarters--despite quite limited  progress  thus

far  this  year--in  light  of  some  continuing  slack  in  demands  on  produc-

tion  resources  and  efforts  by  businesses  to  contain  costs. 

A  number

stressed  that  the  moderate  monetary  growth  over  recent  years  suggested

that  monetary  policy  had  been  positioned  to  foster  a  reduction  in

inflation,  and  they  anticipated  that  the  beneficial  effects  of  this

policy  would show  through  over  the  projection  period.

In keeping with the practice at  meetings when the  Committee

considers  its  long-run ranges  for the  money and  debt aggregates,  the

members  of  the  Committee  and  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  presidents  not

currently serving as  members provided specific projections  of the  growth

in  real  and nominal  GNP, the  rate  of  unemployment, and the  rate  of

inflation for  1991 and 1992.  These  projections took account  of  the

monetary  growth  ranges  that  the  Committee  reaffirmed  for  1991  and  estab-

lished  on  a  tentative  basis  for  1992  at  this  meeting;  these  ranges  are

expected to be  consistent  with the  Committee's  goal of  promoting a sus-

tained  expansion  in  the economy,  fostered  by  further  progress  toward

price  stability.  Forecasts of nominal GNP  converged on  growth rates  of

4-1/2  to 5-1/4 percent  for  1991  and 5-1/2 to  6-1/2  percent  for  1992.

With  regard  to  the rate  of  expansion  in  real  GNP, 

the  projections  had  a

central  tendency  of  3/4  to  1  percent  for  1991  as  a  whole, 

implying  a

sizable  rebound  over  the  balance  of  the  year;  for  the  year  1992,  the

central tendency of the projections  was  2-1/4  to  3 percent.  While the

civilian unemployment  rate  was  not projected to  fall much over  the

balance of the  year, the expansion was  expected to  result  in a decline

to  a somewhat  lower  range of  6-1/4 to  6-1/2  percent by the  fourth

quarter  of 1992.  With regard to  the  rate of  inflation  as  measured by

the  consumer  price index, the  projections  had a central tendency of

3-1/4  to 3-3/4  percent  for  1991  and  3 to  4 percent  for  1992;  because

declines  in  energy prices  had damped  the  rise of  consumer prices  sub-

stantially thus  far in 1991,  the  similarity of the ranges  for the  two

years  masked expectations  of a pronounced  decline in the  core  rate  of

inflation.

In the  course of the  Committee's  discussion, members  reported

tha'  business  conditions  remained uneven,  depending on the mix of local

industries,  but  overall economic  activity now appeared to  be  expanding

at  a modest  pace  in  a number  of regions  and to  have stabilized  following

earlier  declines  in  several  other parts  of the  nation.  However, in some

areas,  notably portions  of  the Northeast,  business  activity appeared to

be  weakening further.  Business  sentiment  remained  cautious  on the

whole,  but many business  contacts  were  expressing greater  confidence  in

the  outlook  for  the  economy and  their  own industries,  at  least  looking

ahead to  1992.  Agriculture was  a source  of  strength  in many parts  of

the  country, but  drought conditions  in  some  areas  and excessive  rains  in

others had  given  rise  to  some  concerns.

As  has  tended to  occur  in  the  early  stages  of previous  cyclical

recoveries,  the  swing  in business  inventories  from substantial  liquida-

tion toward  accumulation was  likely  to  play  a leading role  in  bolstering

the expansion during the next two or three quarters.  The members ac-

knowledged that  inventory developments were  difficult  to project, and

views differed to  some  extent  regarding the  strength of the impetus that

might be  forthcoming from this  source over the next  few  quarters.  In

any event, the available data tended to confirm reports  from business

contacts regarding the absence of excessive  stocks in most  sectors  of

the economy and parts  of  the country.  In these  circumstances,  the

firming in final sales that  appeared to be under way was  likely to

result  in a cessation of  inventory liquidation over the  nearer term and

to induce an actual buildup at  some point  later.  It was  suggested that

this  process already had begun and might  indeed be  somewhat  ahead of

earlier expectations.

While the swing in inventories  was  likely to provide a substan-

tial boost  to economic activity over the next  few  quarters,  some members

questioned the  potential strength of  ongoing factors promoting expansion

once  the adjustment  in  inventories  had largely run its  course.  Growth

in  consumer spending might  well remain relatively  restrained.  The

saving rate  already was  low,  and the willingness or ability of many

consumers to  incur debt to  finance increased spending would tend to be

inhibited by existing debt burdens  and perhaps  also  by the  loss  of tax

deductibility on consumer  loan interest.  In addition,  widespread pub-

licity about the  fragility of  some financial  institutions  and continuing

concerns  about  employment prospects might damp  consumer sentiment,  and

the absence of a strong rebound in residential  construction would tend

to moderate the growth in spending on  consumer durables 

On the  posi-

tive side, the  favorable effects  on disposable  income of the  earlier

-10-

decline  in oil  prices was being supplemented by a resumption of  appre-

ciable growth  in personal  income  as  final  sales  and production improved.

With regard to the outlook for business  fixed investment,  con-

tacts  around  the  nation  suggested that  business  executives  remained

cautious  about making  capital  spending  commitments.  Nonetheless, the

recent pickup  in new orders for business  equipment  and a more mixed

pattern in nonresidential  building contract  awards and permits  were

promising developments  that tended to  reduce earlier concerns  about  a

possible  cumulative weakening  in business  investment.  Among the  com-

ponents  of this  key sector of the  economy, nonresidential  construction

activity was  expected to remain depressed, probably for an extended

period  in many localities,  because of the  substantial overhang of  vacant

office  space  and other  commercial  facilities.  Some members  noted,

however, that nonresidential  construction was  improving  in  some areas,

in  part as  a result  of public works  projects.  Despite the  likelihood of

persisting weakness  in nonresidential  construction, overall business

fixed investment  was  expected to  strengthen to a limited extent  once the

recovery  in economic  activity was more  firmly established.

The outlook for  residential construction was viewed as  somewhat

more promising.  Home  sales  appeared to be on a distinct  uptrend, not-

withstanding the  temporary  reversal in new home  sales  in May, and resi-

dential  construction  was picking up  in many areas  as  housing backlogs

were worked  lower.  Members commented,  however, that the  upswing in  such

construction might be  relatively  subdued by past  cyclical  standards,

reflecting fairly high  vacancy rates  and the  failure  of mortgage rates

-11-

to decline  as  much as  they had  in previous  recession periods.  Continu-

ing constraints  on the availability  of  loans  for  land acquisition and

construction might also be a factor tending to  inhibit  construction

activity, at  least  currently.

With regard to the  financial  setting of  the  economy more

generally, members  noted that  the  distress  being experienced by some

financial intermediaries  was  a key  source of  concern and downside risk

for the economy.  One  could not  rule out  a major deterioration in  con-

fidence in one  or more types  of lenders,  which could  seriously  disrupt

their ability or willingness to  supply  credit.  However, that  risk  was

likely to  lessen over time.  The  rebuilding of balance  sheets,  including

those of  commercial banks,  was  a promising development,  and the  strength

of the  stock market along with  lower  risk premia on debt  obligations

pointed to an  improving  financial climate.  Borrowers  with direct  access

to  capital markets were  finding abundant  credit  at  lower  spreads.  Many

depository institutions apparently were  continuing  to pursue very

cautious  lending policies,  though the  shift  toward even more  stringent

terms on  loans  seemed to have abated. 

Overall, debt  growth appeared

be quite  sluggish, with much of the weakness concentrated at  depository

institutions;  this  probably was  contributing to the  relatively damped

expansion  of the  monetary aggregates  around the  cycle trough.  The  rela-

tionship between borrowing and spending  seemed to be adjusting in ways

that  were not  entirely understood, but  the  behavior of both debt and

money were  cautionary  signs  that  needed to be monitored carefully.

A number  of members commented that  in comparison with  prior

cyclical  experience the  budget  policies  of all levels  of  government were

-12-

likely to be relatively restrictive  over the  projection horizon.  At the

federal level,  despite burgeoning borrowing requirements  in  the  near

term, cutbacks  in  defense  spending and other efforts to  curb expendi-

tures under the budget  agreement  of 1990  and to maintain that control

under procedures put  in place by the  agreement,  appeared to have helped

put  federal spending for goods  and services  on a downward path.  At the

state  and local  level,  severe  budgetary problems  were being addressed in

many areas  by increased taxes and restraints  on spending.  These efforts

to control  governmental  spending  were  likely to be  an important  factor

contributing to a subdued expansion in nonresidential  construction.

Turning to the  outlook for  inflation, the  members  remained

optimistic that  substantial progress  could be made  in reducing its

underlying  rate over the  projection horizon.  Some expressed disappoint-

ment that, while  a number of  special  factors  had been involved,  the

deceleration  in  consumer  prices had been very limited this  year, ex-

cluding the effects of a sharp drop  in  energy prices and  slower  in-

creases in food prices.  Nonetheless,  the members  generally believed

that  if the  recovery tended to unfold as  they were projecting, pressures

on production resources  would remain  subdued and efforts  to  contain

labor and other business costs  would continue,  especially in the  context

of very competitive markets  for most  products.  Additionally, the  appre-

ciation of the dollar this year  could be expected to exert  a damping

effect  on inflation.  As  a trend toward  lower inflation became more pro-

nounced and widely perceived, the disinflationary forces  in the  economy

would be reinforced by a moderation of  inflationary expectations.  An

integral part of these  developments,  which several members emphasized,

-13-

was  the  role  of restrained monetary expansion over an extended period in

curbing underlying  inflation pressures

Against  the background of the Committee's  views regarding

prospective economic developments  and  in keeping with the  requirements

of  the  Full  Employment  and Balanced Growth Act  of 1978  (the Humphrey-

Hawkins  Act),  the Committee  at  this meeting reviewed the ranges  for

growth in the monetary and debt  aggregates that  it  had  set  in February

for  1991,  and it  established on a tentative basis  ranges  for  growth in

those measures  in 1992.  The  current  ranges  included growth of  2-1/2 to

6-1/2  percent  for M2  and  1 to 5 percent  for M3  for  the period  from the

fourth quarter of  1990 to the  fourth quarter of 1991.  A monitoring

range  of 4-1/2  to  8-1/2 percent had been set  for  growth in  total domes-

tic  nonfinancial debt  in  1991.

In  the  course of the  Committee's  deliberations,  all  of  the

members  agreed that  the  ranges  established  for this  year remained

appropriate.  The members  noted that  both M2  and M3  were  in  the middle

portions  of their ranges.  With  regard to developments  affecting M2,

growth of  nominal income had  weakened over  the first  half  of the year,

but demands  for M2  balances had been bolstered by declines  in market

interest  rates  that  had brought  a narrowing of  the  opportunity costs

associated with holding deposits.  On balance,  growth of  this  aggregate

thus  far  in  1991  had  fallen short  of what  might  have been expected  on

the  basis  of historical  relationships  with nominal  income  and  interest

rates.  The  reasons  for  the  shortfalls were  not  fully  understood, but

the  continuing  redirection  of  credit  flows  away from depository institu-

-14-

tions  and toward market  channels  as  well as apparent  investor prefer-

ences for the higher yields offered by longer-term investments appeared

to be  contributing factors.  The projected pickup in nominal  GNP growth

in the second half of the year would by itself tend to boost the growth

of  M2 somewhat, but increases  in velocity also were quite possible.  Any

strengthening of M2 probably would be  limited by some widening of oppor-

tunity costs associated with a further decline in  offering rates  on

liquid deposits in lagged response  to earlier declines in market rates.

Moreover, the likely persistence of a steep yield  curve could lead

depositors to  continue to place  some maturing time deposits  in long-term

market instruments that  had more attractive yields,  such as bond mutual

funds.  Considerable uncertainty continued to  surround the  demand for

money and the behavior of  velocity.  However, in the  judgment  of the

Committee,  it now seemed that  growth within the  current range would

indicate that  policy was  positioned to  foster a sustainable economic

expansion,  and that the four percentage-point range provided adequate

leeway  for any  adjustments that might be needed  in the event the  economy

or monetary velocity were to diverge substantially from their expected

paths.

Through the  remainder of  1991,  M3  growth also could  be expected

to be boosted by the strengthening  of the  recovery,  which was  likely to

stimulate some pickup  in bank  credit extensions.  However, a faster  pace

of  resolutions by the Resolution Trust  Corporation  (RTC) would tend to

depress  thrift  credit--by placing more thrift  assets  under government

control or  in the hands  of private nondepository institutions--and

issuance of  large time  deposits by branches and agencies of  foreign

-15-

banks  could be expected to slow from the pace earlier  in the year  as

more of the  adjustment  to the  change in relative borrowing costs  caused

by the  reduction in reserve requirements  late  last  year was  completed.

The members  took note of  a number of  factors that  had tended  to

depress the growth of domestic nonfinancial debt,  which had been growing

at  the low end of the Committee's monitoring range.  The  latter included

the  slower pace of economic activity, more  cautious attitudes  on the

part  of borrowers  toward taking  on debt  and lenders  toward extending it,

and a sharply  lower pace  of  net equity  retirements.  Looking ahead, the

members  anticipated that,  with the pickup in the  economy,  nonfinancial

debt  would expand more  rapidly in the  second half of the  year.  While

slowing debt  growth had a number of positive aspects  for the  long-run

stability of the financial markets  and the  economy, a tendency  for  debt

to drop  below its  current  range might  indicate that  supply or  demand

conditions  were  inconsistent  with a satisfactory economic expansion.

At the  conclusion of this  discussion, the  Committee  voted to

approve the  following broad policy statement  and to  reaffirm the  1991

ranges that  it  had established in February  for growth of M2,  M3,  and

nonfinancial debt:

The  Federal  Open Market  Committee seeks  monetary and

financial  conditions  that  will  foster price  stability and
promote  sustainable  growth in output.  In  furtherance  of
these  objectives,  the  Committee  reaffirmed at  this meeting
the  ranges  it had established  in February  for  growth of M2
and M3  of  2-1/2  to  6-1/2  percent and 1 to  5 percent,
respectively, measured from the  fourth quarter of  1990  to
the  fourth quarter of  1991.  The monitoring range  for
growth  of total  domestic  nonfinancial  debt  also was
maintained at  4-1/2  to 8-1/2  percent  for the year.

Votes  for this  action:  Messrs.  Greenspan,

Corrigan, Angell,  Black, Forrestal, Keehn, Kelley,
LaWare, Mullins, and Parry.

Votes against this  action:  None.

-16-

In the Committee's  discussion of  the  ranges  for  1992,  most  of

the members  supported  a proposal  to  extend the  1991  ranges  provisionally

to  next  year.  Insofar  as  developments bearing  on economic and  financial

conditions  in  1992  could be  anticipated at  this  point,  these members

believed  that monetary growth within the  current  ranges  would be  con-

sistent  with sustainable  economic  expansion in  the  context  of  continuing

progress  toward price stability.  The  upper bounds  of  those  ranges  pro-

vided desirable leeway  for policy to resist  any tendency  for  the  recov-

ery to  falter while the lower ends  allowed ample  room for policy to

counter  stronger-than-expected inflationary pressures.

Several members  favored a reduction in the  M2  range  for next

year.  Such a move would continue  the trend  of moving the range  downward

until  it  was  consistent with price  stability.  Recent  developments

suggested that  conditions  were  favorable  for making substantial progress

toward lower  inflation,  and these members  emphasized that  it  was  impor-

tant  for  the  Committee  not  only to  take  advantage  of  this opportunity

but to  signal  its  determination in  this  regard.  The  resulting improve-

ment  in the  credibility of the  Committee's  anti-inflationary policy  and

the  related  favorable effects  on  inflationary  expectations would  reduce

the transitional costs  of  achieving price stability.

Those  in  favor  of  retaining the  current  range  for M2  commented

that  the  range  had been reduced  substantially in  recent  years  and that

its  midpoint  already was  close to  a rate  consistent with price  stability

over time,  presuming no  unanticipated trend  in the velocity  of M2  and

some  upward bias  in measured  inflation.  For  1992,  some  members were

concerned that,  absent  a significant  increase  in the velocity  of M2,

-17-

satisfactory nominal  GNP  growth--within the central  tendency  of  the

members'  forecasts--already implied expansion of M2  in  the  upper part  of

a 2-1/2  to  6-1/2 percent  range.  A lower  range might not  provide  suffi-

cient  flexibility to deal  with an unanticipated  shortfall in aggregate

demand or  disturbances to  still-fragile  financial markets.  Uncertain-

ties  about  the behavior  of velocity at  a time  when an  important  restruc-

turing of  financial flows  appeared to be  in process,  especially with

regard to  the  role of depository  institutions,  also  argued  for simply

carrying  over the  existing  range.  There would be  an opportunity to

review the  range  next  February, when evidence  would be  in  hand about

velocity  in the  second half  of  the  year and  some  of  the  uncertainties

about the  strength of the  recovery would be  diminished.  At  that time,

careful  consideration would need  to be  given to reducing the  range,  if

conditions  implied that  such an  action was appropriate  in  furthering and

underscoring the  System's  goal  of  reducing  inflation over time.

At  the conclusion of this  discussion, with two members

dissenting, the Committee  approved provisional ranges  for  1992  that  were

unchanged from those  for 1991,  and  it  voted to  incorporate the  following

statement  regarding the  1992  ranges  in  its  domestic policy directive:

For  1992,  on  a tentative basis,  the Committee  agreed

to  use the  same  ranges  as  in  1991  for  growth  in  each  of
the monetary aggregates  and debt,  measured from the  fourth
quarter  of  1991  to the  fourth  quarter of  1992.  With
regard  to M3,  the  Committee  anticipated that the  ongoing
restructuring  of thrift  depository institutions would
continue  to depress  the  growth of  this  aggregate relative
to  spending  and total  credit.  The  behavior of  the
monetary aggregates  will  continue to be  evaluated in  the
light  of  progress  toward price  level  stability, movements
in  their velocities,  and  developments  in  the economy and
financial markets.

-18-

Votes  for  this  action:  Messrs.  Greenspan,

Corrigan, Forrestal,  Keehn, Kelley, LaWare, Mullins,
and Parry.

Votes  against  this  action:  Messrs. Angell  and

Black.

Messrs.  Angell and Black dissented because  they preferred to

reduce  the M2  range  for  1992 by  1/2  percentage point.  They pointed out

that  the  lower range would be  centered on  the  average growth  of M2  in

recent years  and would provide a timely  signal  of  the Committee's  con-

tinuing  commitment to price  stability, thereby reinforcing  and extending

the progress  in  curbing inflation anticipated over the next  several

quarters.  They believed that  the  resulting decline  in inflationary

expectations would lower the  transitional  costs of  achieving price

stability  and,  by  favorably affecting long-term interest rates,  would

help  sustain the expansion  in  economic activity.

In the  Committee's  discussion  of policy  for  the intermeeting

period ahead, all  of the members were  in favor  of maintaining  an un-

changed  degree  of pressure on  reserve positions.  They believed that  at

this  juncture  an unchanged policy  course  offered the greatest promise  of

reconciling the  Committee's  goals  of sustaining the nascent business

recovery while  also fostering  further  progress against  inflation.  There

were  obvious  areas  of  uncertainty and vulnerability  in the  current

economic and  financial  situation, but  developments  were  unlikely to

require  an  immediate  adjustment  in  reserve market  conditions.  For now,

monetary  policy appeared to be  on  an  appropriate  course.

The members  devoted some  attention during this  discussion to

the relatively  sluggish growth  of M2  and M3  in  recent months.  Some

commented that  the behavior of  the broader  aggregates might  imply  that

-19-

monetary policy had not  been eased sufficiently in  recent months  and

therefore might  not provide  adequate support  to sustain the  expansion.

It was  noted, however, that  apart  from the usual uncertainties  about the

relationship of M2 and M3 to  growth and spending in  the  short  run, the

expansion of Ml  and especially of reserves  and the monetary base had

been fairly robust  since  early spring.  Moreover, many borrowers were

meeting their  financing  needs  through market  sources.  In this  situa-

tion, the members  generally concluded that  the behavior  of M2  and M3,

which  on a cumulative basis  were  still  in  the middle  portions of the

Committee's  ranges  for the  year, did not  call  for  any policy adjustments

at  this point.  Nonetheless,  continuing  weak  growth might  require  a

review of  this  conclusion.  A staff projection prepared for  this meeting

indicated that,  with reserve market  conditions  unchanged, somewhat

faster  growth  in the broader  aggregates was  likely to  emerge  in  the

months  ahead, induced by  greater money demands  in the  context  of a

strengthening  economy.

With regard to possible adjustments  to the degree  of reserve

pressure  during the intermeeting period ahead, nearly all  the members

expressed a preference  for a directive  that  did  not  bias  prospective

operations  toward tightening or easing but made  an intermeeting adjust-

ment,  if  any,  equally likely  in either  direction  depending on economic

and  financial  developments  and the  behavior of  the monetary aggregates.

One member  preferred a directive  that  was  tilted toward possible

tightening;  in  this view,  a prompt  response  to any tendency  for  infla-

tionary conditions  to  re-emerge would have  a favorable  effect  on  infla-

tionary expectations  and long-term debt markets and might avert  the  need

-20-

for  a more  substantial policy adjustment  later.  Other members  agreed on

the  desirability  of  a prompt adjustment  to  inflationary developments,

but  they did not  see  a special  need to anticipate  such an  adjustment  in

the  period ahead.

At  the  conclusion of the  Committee's discussion, all  of the

members  indicated that  they favored a directive  that  called for main-

taining the  existing degree of  pressure on  reserve positions.  The

members  also noted that  they preferred or  could accept  a directive that

did not  include  a presumption  about  the  likely direction of  any inter-

meeting adjustments  in policy.  Accordingly, the  Committee  decided that

somewhat  greater  reserve  restraint or  somewhat  lesser  reserve restraint

might be  acceptable during the  period ahead  depending on progress  toward

price  stability,  trends in economic  activity, the  behavior  of the

monetary aggregates, and  developments  in  foreign exchange  and domestic

financial markets.  The reserve  conditions  contemplated at  this meeting

were expected  to  be  consistent  with  some increase  in the  growth  of M2

and M3  to annual  rates  of  around 5-1/2  and 3 percent  respectively  over

the three-month period  from June through September.

At  the  conclusion of the meeting, the  following domestic policy

directive was  issued to the  Federal  Reserve Bank  of New York:

The  information reviewed at  this meeting suggests

that economic  activity has  begun to  recover  from the
recent  recession.  The unemployment rate  rose to  6.9
percent in May, but  total  nonfarm payroll employment
edged up and the  average  workweek posted  a sizable
gain.  Manufacturing output has  risen in  recent months,
led  by appreciable  increases  in assemblies  of motor
vehicles.  Consumer  spending has  been  bolstered in part
by an  upturn in  personal  income.  An increase  in  orders
points to  a firming  in  demand for business  equipment,
but  nonresidential construction remains  weak.  Housing
starts  rose  over April  and May.  The  nominal  U.S.

-21-

merchandise trade deficit  in April  was  somewhat below
the  average  rate in the  first  quarter.  Increases  in
consumer prices  have been  small in recent  months.

Most  interest  rates have  risen slightly since the
Committee meeting on May 14.  The trade-weighted value
of  the  dollar in terms  of the  other G-10 currencies
increased substantially on balance over the  inter-
meeting period.

M2 grew at  a moderate  pace  over May and  June,

while M3  changed little.  For the year thus  far,  ex-
pansion of M2  and M3  has  been  in the middle portion of
the Committee's  ranges.

The  Federal Open Market Committee seeks  monetary

and  financial  conditions that  will  foster  price  sta-
bility and promote sustainable  growth  in output.  In
furtherance  of these objectives,  the  Committee re-
affirmed at  this meeting the  ranges  it  had established
in February  for  growth of M2  and M3  of 2-1/2  to  6-1/2
percent  and 1 to  5 percent,  respectively, measured from
the  fourth  quarter of  1990 to  the  fourth quarter of
1991.  The  monitoring range  for  growth of total domes-
tic nonfinancial debt  also was  maintained  at  4-1/2  to
8-1/2  percent  for  the  year.  For 1992,  on  a tentative
basis,  the  Committee agreed to  use  the  same  ranges  as
in  1991  for  growth in each of the monetary  aggregates
and debt,  measured from the  fourth  quarter  of  1991  to
the  fourth quarter of 1992.  With regard to M3,  the
Committee anticipated that the  ongoing restructuring  of
thrift depository  institutions  would continue  to
depress  the growth of this aggregate  relative  to
spending and total  credit.  The behavior  of the
monetary aggregates will  continue to be  evaluated in
the  light of progress toward price  level  stability,
movements  in their velocities,  and developments  in the
economy and  financial markets.

In the  implementation of policy for  the  immediate

future, the  Committee seeks  to maintain the  existing
degree of pressure on  reserve positions.  Depending
upon progress  toward price  stability, trends  in
economic activity,  the behavior of  the monetary
aggregates,  and developments  in foreign exchange  and
domestic  financial markets,  somewhat  greater  reserve
restraint  or  somewhat lesser  reserve  restraint  might be
acceptable  in the  intermeeting period.  The  contem-
plated reserve  conditions  are  expected to be  consistent
with growth of M2  and M3 over the  period  from June
through September at  annual  rates  of about  5-1/2  and 3
percent,  respectively.

RECORD  OF  POLICY ACTIONS  OF  THE

FEDERAL  OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE

Meeting  Held  on October  1, 1991

Domestic  Policy Directive:

The information reviewed  at  this  meeting suggested  on  balance

that  the economy was  continuing to  recover  from the  recession  but  that

its  performance was  uneven across  sectors.  Consumer  spending was

rising,  especially for  durable  goods,  but  businesses  remained cautious

about investing  in  plant,  equipment,  or  inventories.  On  the produc-

tion  side, the  advance in  manufacturing  activity continued,  although

the  recovery in housing  construction  appeared  to  have  lost  some  of  the

momentum evident  through  the  spring,  and  little  growth was  occurring

in much  of the  service-producing sector.  The  pickup  in  production had

been  reflected  primarily in a sizable  rise  in  aggregate hours worked

rather  than  in  the  number  of  jobs.  Increases  in  prices  appeared  to be

on  a gradual  downtrend.

In  August,  total nonfarm payroll  employment retraced part  of

a July decline  and  on  balance was  little  changed  since March.  Manu-

facturing employment  registered widespread  gains  in  August,  and the

factory workweek rose  to  its  highest  level  in  nearly  a year.  In  the

private  service-producing  sector, new hires  in health  and  business

services  displayed  appreciable  strength, but  the  rest  of this  sector,

particularly wholesale and  retail  trade,  remained  weak.  Jobs  in

construction continued  to decline,  and  employment  reductions  occurred

in  state  and local  governments  for  a second  straight  month.  The

civilian unemployment  rate was  6.8  percent  in both  July  and  August.

Industrial production posted  a moderate further  rise  in

August  after  several months  of  sizable gains.  Assemblies  of motor

vehicles  slowed in  August when a number  of  plants  were  closed tempo-

rarily for  model changeovers, but  output  of  other  consumer  durables

continued to  increase and  output  of  consumer  nondurables  rebounded.

Production  of business  equipment  remained weak and  on balance  had

changed  little since  spring after  dropping sharply  in  late 1990  and

early  1991.  Total  industrial  capacity utilization  edged up  in August,

and  over the  course of  recent months  it  had  retraced only a small part

of  the  decline that  occurred between  mid-1990  and  March  1991.

Operating rates  in  manufacturing had  recovered  to  a somewhat  greater

extent,  reflecting  in  part  the  rebound in motor-vehicle  assemblies.

Retail  sales  fell  in  August, mostly  because of  a decline  in

sales  of motor  vehicles.  For  July  and August  together,  nonautomotive

retail  sales  were up  considerably  on  balance.  After  increasing

appreciably  since January, housing  starts  rose  only  slightly further

in  July and  August.  The number  of  permits  for  construction  of  single-

family homes  declined  in  August and  was  unchanged  from the  second-

quarter  level.  In  the multifamily  sector,  construction  activity

remained  near  its  thirty-year  low.  Sales  of new homes  were  down  in

July, while  sales  of  existing homes  fell  in  both July  and August.

Shipments  of  nondefense capital  goods,  measured  in  nominal

terms,  were down  on  balance  over  July  and  August.  Taking into  account

the  substantial  recent  declines  in the prices  of  computing  equipment,

however,  real  outlays  for  business  equipment  apparently rose  on

balance  over  the two months  as  reduced spending  on  industrial

equipment was more than  offset by  increased  investment  in  computers

and,  to  a lesser  extent,  transportation equipment.  Recent data  on

orders  and  shipments  of nondefense capital  goods  pointed  to  a further

small rise  in  real  outlays  for  business  equipment.  The value  of

nonresidential  construction put  in  place  in  July was  substantially

below the second-quarter  level,  reflecting the continuing  decline in

office, other  commercial,  and hotel  construction.  Available

information  on  new  contracts  suggested a continuing  downtrend in

nonresidential  construction.

The nominal U.S. merchandise trade  deficit widened  substan-

tially  in  July to  a rate considerably above  its  average  in  the  second

quarter.  In  July,  the  value  of  imports  rose  sharply from a low

second-quarter  average;  the  rise was  concentrated  in  consumer  goods,

automobiles,  and  computers.  The  value  of exports  changed  little  in

July from a second-quarter  level  that was  high  compared  with other

recent  quarters;  the improvement  in  exports  in  recent months had  been

the  result  of  the  strong performance  of  capital  goods.  The pattern  of

economic  activity  in the major  foreign industrial  countries  continued

to  be mixed.  In western Germany  and Japan,  growth  fell  sharply in  the

second  quarter  and  apparently remained  slow  in  the  third  quarter,

while  economic  activity picked up  in  some  other  industrial  countries

in  the second  quarter.

Producer  prices  of  finished  goods were unchanged  over  July

and August  after  declining  on balance in  earlier  months  of  the  year.

Further  reductions  in  food  prices  in August,  notably  prices  of  fresh

fruits  and vegetables,  offset  a rebound  in the  prices  of  finished

energy goods.  Excluding food  and  energy, the increase  in  producer

prices  of  finished  goods  in the  twelve months  ended  in  August was

little  different from  the  rise over  the  previous  twelve  months.  At

the  consumer  level,  increases  in  prices were  small  in  July and  August

because  of  declines  in  the  prices  of  food  and  energy items.  Although

nonfood,  non-energy consumer  prices had  risen  somewhat  faster  in

recent  months,  the  twelve-month change in  this  index had  continued  to

edge  down.

At  its  meeting on  August  20,  1991,  the  Committee  adopted  a

directive that  called  for maintaining  the existing  degree of  pressure

on  reserve positions  and  that  also  provided  for  giving special weight

to  potential  developments  that might  require some  further  easing

during the  intermeeting period.  Accordingly, the  Committee  decided

that  somewhat  greater  reserve restraint  might  be  acceptable or

somewhat  lesser  reserve restraint  would be  acceptable during the

intermeeting period depending on  progress  toward  price stability,

trends  in  economic  activity,  the behavior  of  the monetary aggregates,

and  developments  in foreign  exchange  and  domestic  financial  markets.

The  reserve conditions  contemplated at  the August  meeting were

expected to  be  consistent with  a resumption  in  the  growth  of M2  and M3

over  the balance  of the  third quarter.  However,  in  view  of  the

declines  in  these  aggregates  that had  taken  place since  June,  the

Committee anticipated  that,  over  the three-month  period  from June

through September,  M2  would  be  little changed  and  M3 would be  down  at

an  annual  rate  of  about  1 percent.

Open market operations  during  the intermeeting  period were

directed  initially toward  maintaining the  existing  pressures  on

reserve positions.  Subsequently,  on  September  13,  the  discount  rate

was  lowered by  1/2  percentage point  to  5 percent  and part  of this

decline was  allowed to  show through to  the federal  funds  rate.  Two

technical  decreases to  expected levels  of adjustment  plus  seasonal

borrowing were made  during the  intermeeting period to  reflect  the

abatement  of  seasonal  credit  needs.  Early in the  period,  adjustment

plus  seasonal borrowing averaged  nearly  $400  million.  Later,  in  part

because  of  the  decline  in  seasonal funding  needs,  the volume of

borrowing  slipped below $350 million.  The federal  funds  rate  averaged

around  5-1/2  percent during the first  part  of  the intermeeting period,

but  after  the discount  rate was  reduced,  the  federal funds  rate  edged

down  to a little above  5-1/4  percent.

In  the  period immediately after  the August  20  meeting, most

other  market  interest  rates  rose  slightly,  reflecting in part  the

absence  of  an  anticipated  easing of  monetary policy and  data  indica-

ting that the  expansion might  be  more robust  than  expected.  Treasury

bill  rates  also  were boosted by an unwinding  of the  flight to  quality

and  liquidity that  had  been  prompted  by the  attempted  coup in  the

Soviet  Union.  In  subsequent weeks, market  rates  declined  as  incoming

nonfinancial  and monetary indicators were  seen by market participants

as  portending a sluggish expansion,  reduced  inflation, and  an

associated easing  of monetary policy.  The average  commitment  rate on

fixed-rate mortgages  reached its  lowest  level  since  1977,  and the

prime  rate was  reduced by  1/2  percentage point  to  8 percent  after  the

easing of  monetary policy  in  mid-September.  The  trade-weighted  value

of  the dollar  in  terms  of  the  other  G-10  currencies  fell  sharply over

the  intermeeting period;  much  of  the  drop retraced  the  previous  run-up

associated with  the  attempted  coup  in  the  Soviet  Union  that  began

shortly before the  August meeting.

After  contracting in  July,  M2  was about  unchanged  in  August

and  September.  M3  declined further  in  July  and August  and  apparently

changed  little  in  September.  Both aggregates  were somewhat weaker

than  anticipated  at  the time  of the August meeting.  For the  year  thus

far,  expansion  of M2  and M3  had  been at  the  lower  ends  of  the

Committee's  ranges.

The  staff projection  prepared for  this meeting pointed to  a

sustained  recovery  in  economic  activity;  however,  because  of  per-

sisting  weaknesses  in  some  sectors  of  the  economy the  pace  of  the

expansion was projected  to  remain  subdued  compared with  past  cyclical

experience  and  the  risks  of  a different  outcome seemed  to  be mostly on

the  downside.  Consumer  spending was  expected  to  continue to  provide

much  of  the impetus to  the  expansion, but  a swing  from inventory

liquidation to  modest accumulation was  projected  to  supply  an

additional  boost to  economic  growth  during the  quarters  immediately

ahead.  As  the stimulus  from the swing  in inventories  began to wane

during  the course  of  1992,  spending  for  business  equipment was

projected  to  strengthen to  some  extent.  Housing  construction also

would provide  some  stimulus  over  the  projection horizon.  Further

declines  in  the construction  of  commercial  structures  were  expected  to

inhibit the  economic  expansion.  Additionally,  real purchases  of  goods

and  services by  the federal  government were  assumed to  be  on  a mildly

declining trend,  and  spending  by many  state  and  local  governments was

expected to  be  constrained by  severe  budgetary  problems.  The  persist-

ing  slack in  labor  and  product markets,  while diminishing  over time,

was  projected to  restrain  the  rise in  labor  costs  and  to  foster  some

slowing  in  the underlying trend  of  inflation.

In  the  Committee's review of  prevailing and prospective

economic  developments, members  observed  that  the mixed nature of  the

recent  economic  information and the uneven  economic  conditions  in

different  parts  of  the  country made  it  particularly  difficult  to

assess  the  overall  state  of the  economy.  They generally  concluded

that,  on balance, the  evidence was  consistent with a continuing though

still sluggish  recovery  in  economic  activity and  that  the prospects

remained favorable  for  a sustained  expansion at  a moderate pace  over

the next  several quarters.  Many  commented, however,  that  the  risks  to

the  expansion  appeared to  be tilted  at  least  marginally to  the

downside.  Those risks  were felt  to  stem especially from a variety  of

financial  strains  in  the  economy, and  several members  also  indicated

that  they were uneasy about the potential  implications  of the ongoing

weakness  in broad  measures  of money and  credit.  With  regard to the

outlook for  inflation, many of  the members  expressed confidence that

the  relatively moderate  rate  of  expansion in  economic  activity that

they anticipated was  likely to  be associated with appreciable progress

in reducing the core  rate of  inflation over  the  next several  quarters.

In  the  course  of  the  Committee's  discussion, members

commented  that  the anecdotal  reports  on  economic  conditions  and  on

business  and  consumer  sentiment continued  to  have a generally negative

tone  that did not  appear to  be  fully consistent  with the available

economic  statistics.  To  a degree, business  attitudes seemed to

reflect  perceptions  of  little  momentum in  business  activity  and

related  concerns about  the  outlook for  profits.  On  the  positive  side,

business  conditions  in  some areas  were contributing  to  some  optimism,

at  least  among business  managers whose activities tended to  be  limited

to local  markets,  and the  performance  of  the  stock market  continued  to

provide  evidence of  confidence on  the part  of  many investors.

Turning to the  outlook for key  sectors  of the  economy,

members  noted that  despite  reports  of  quite  weak  retail  sales  in  some

parts  of  the country,  real  consumer  outlays  had  been trending upward

on  an  overall basis  since  the  early part  of  the  year, and  in the

absence  of a new adverse  shock to  consumer  confidence, consumers  were

likely  to  continue  to  provide  important  support  to  the  overall

economic  expansion.  However,  the  extent  of  that  support might  remain

somewhat  limited because consumer  sentiment was  still  cautious  amid

concerns  about  employment  opportunities  and  personal  debt  burdens.  In

the  circumstances,  retailers  in many areas  anticipated  relatively

sluggish  sales  during  the  upcoming holiday season.  In the  context  of

an  already low saving rate,  the  outlook for  retail  sales  would

continue  to  hinge  on  growth  in disposable incomes  and the  latter  in

turn would tend  to  be  constrained by  the moderate growth that  was

anticipated  in  overall  economic  activity.

The members  continued to  anticipate that  a turnaround  from

inventory liquidation  to  at  least modest  accumulation would stimulate

the  economy  in  the  quarters ahead.  Available data  and  anecdotal

reports  suggested  that  overall nonfarm business  inventories  had

continued to  decline through  July  and  probably  over  the  third  quarter

as  a whole.  With  stocks  now at  generally  low levels,  a pickup  in

final  demands,  including expected  further  growth  in  exports,  was

likely  to  foster  some tendency to  rebuild  inventories.  Looking

further  ahead,  some  concern was  expressed that,  once the  expected

swing  in  inventories  began to  abate next  year  in  line with  the usual

cyclical  pattern,  other  sources  of  economic  stimulus  might  not

materialize  to the  extent  needed to  support continued  economic  growth

at  an  adequate  pace.  On  the  other hand,  some members  observed that

both  the economic  statistics and  reports  from business  contacts were

consistent with  some pickup  in business  spending  for  equipment,  which

could  well  strengthen  further  as  the  recovery matured.

Residential  construction  also  seemed  likely to  provide some

ongoing  stimulus  to the  expansion.  While this  sector  appeared to  have

lost  some momentum during the  summer  months,  declines  in mortgage

interest  rates  along with  anticipated moderate  growth in  overall

economic  activity and  incomes pointed  to  a gradual uptrend  in  housing

construction.  The prospective strength  of  housing activity was viewed

as  likely to be  tempered,  however,  by  continuing weakness  in the

multifamily market;  the  latter was  adversely affected  by high vacancy

rates  in many  local  areas  and  over  time by  a slower  pace  of  family

formations.

Among the  negative developments  that could  be  expected  to

limit  the strength  of  the  overall  economic  expansion was the outlook

for  commercial  construction.  Indeed,  the overbuilt  condition  of

commercial space  in major markets  around the  country portended  an

extended period  of weak activity in  this  sector  of the  economy.  There

were,  nonetheless,  anecdotal reports  that  sale  prices  of  commercial

real  estate might  be stabilizing  in  some  areas  and  that  new and

renewal  lease prices  were no  longer  declining  in  some  markets and

indeed might  have  begun to  edge  up.  The  government  sector  also was

seen  as  likely to  exert  some  restraint  on  the  overall  expansion.

Federal government  spending for  goods  and  services  appeared  to  have

swung  into a gradual  downtrend associated with  cutbacks  in  defense

spending.  At the  same time,  the  budgetary difficulties  affecting many

state  and  local  governments were likely  to  continue to  constrain the

overall  growth  in  state and  local  government spending.

Many of  the members  referred  to  the  potential  impact  of

financial  conditions  on the  outlook for  economic  activity.  In  some

important  respects,  financial developments  could  be viewed  as

favorable.  Financial markets were  receptive to  new financing  activity

as  evidenced by  the  large volumes  of  stock  and bond  issuance.

Moreover, the balance  sheets  of many financial  institutions were

improving;  banks,  for  example,  were making considerable  efforts  to

increase  their  capital, work out  problem loans,  and  rationalize  their

operations.  On  the  other hand,  the  balance sheets  of  many business

firms  like those  of a significant portion  of  households were  burdened

by heavy debt  loads.  Furthermore, many  contacts  referred  to the

continuing problems  of  small  and  medium size businesses  in  securing

financing to  carry  on  or  expand  their  operations.  In this  regard,  it

was  difficult to  assess  the extent to  which the weakness  in  loan

-10-

extensions  through  financial  intermediaries  reflected  unwarranted

constraints  on  credit  supplies  as  opposed to  a lack  of  demand  from

qualified  borrowers.  Reports  from  several parts  of  the  country tended

to  suggest  that,  while to  some  extent  credit  standards  had been

tightened  further  this  year,  lenders  remained  willing to  provide

financing to  credit-worthy borrowers.  On  balance, while the members

differed in  their appraisals  of  the  severity  and  possible implications

of  the  financing  problems  of  borrowers without  access to  financial

markets,  they agreed  on the need  for  careful monitoring  of  the

availability of  adequate  credit  to  support a sustained  economic

recovery.

The members  continued to  view the  outlook  for  inflation  as

favorable.  The moderate rate  of  economic  expansion  anticipated  over

the  forecast horizon was  expected  to  be  associated  with  enough  slack

in  productive resources  to  accommodate  further  downward  adjustments  in

the  underlying rate  of  inflation.  Competition  from foreign  producers

was  likely to  remain substantial  in  many domestic  markets.  Indeed,

overall  competitive pressures  and  resistance  to price  increases  were

strong  in  key markets  and  provided  a promising setting  for  progress

toward  price  stability.  From a different  perspective,  a number  of

members  observed  that  the  lagging growth  in  money, at  least  as

measured  by M2  and  M3,  had  favorable  implications  for  prices  over  the

longer  run.  In  particular,  it was  suggested that  the  restrained

growth in  money  over  recent years would  tend to  foster  lower  inflation

while  providing  liquidity  sufficient  to  sustain a moderate  rate  of

economic  expansion.

In  the Committee's  discussion  of  policy for  the  intermeeting

period,  all  of the members  indicated  that  they were  in  favor of

maintaining an  unchanged  degree of pressure on  reserve positions.

-11-

While  the  economy was  subject  to  an  unusual  array of  problems and

related  uncertainties,  the members  generally felt  that  monetary policy

was  on  the right  course under  currently prevailing  and  immediately

forseeable  economic  and  financial  circumstances.  In  particular,

insofar  as  could  be  judged  at  this  point,  the present  policy  stance

provided  an appropriate  balance between  the  risks  of  a faltering

economic  expansion and  the  risks  of  little  or  no  progress  toward price

stability.  The  easing  steps  in  recent months  and  the associated

declines  in  interest  rates,  including mortgage  rates,  appeared to  have

supplied more monetary  stimulus than  had yet  shown through  to  the

economy.  Several  members  commented,  however,  that  the Committee

needed  to  remain  particularly alert  to  indications  of  renewed

weakening in business  activity, especially  given  the current  financial

fragilities  in  the  economy and  the  likely  difficulty of  reviving the

economy  in  the  event  of  another  downturn.  Other  members  gave  somewhat

more  weight to  the  need to  avoid  over-stimulating the economy;  a

failure to  take  advantage  of  the  apparent momentum toward lower

inflation would  have seriously adverse  consequences  on  longer-term

debt  markets  and  the  outlook for  sustained  economic  growth.  The

members  agreed that  a  steady policy  course was  desirable  for  now while

the Committee assessed  the  economy's  responses  to  its  earlier  easing

actions.

In  the  course  of  the  Committee's discussion, the members

expressed  varying  degrees  of  concern  about  the  continuing weakness  in

the  broader  monetary aggregates  and  overall  credit  growth.  It  was

clear  that  a significant restructuring  of household  and  business

balance  sheets was  occurring that  partly  involved adjustments  to the

unusually rapid  buildup  of  debt  during  the 1980's  and  that  such

restructuring  was  being reflected  in  the  behavior  of the broader

-12-

monetary aggregates.  Resolutions  of  insolvent thrift  institutions,

which  in  recent months  had  resumed  in volume,  also were acting to

depress  M2  as  well  as  M3.  In addition,  the more  liquid  components  of

the monetary aggregates were growing  relatively strongly.  Under these

circumstances,  slow growth  in broader  money and  credit did  not

necessarily indicate that  monetary policy was  being too  restrictive by

damping  the  expansion  of  incomes  or  curtailing demands  for  goods and

services.  Moreover,  a staff  analysis  prepared for  this  meeting

indicated  that  some  recovery in the  growth  of  these aggregates  could

be  expected  over  the balance  of  1991,  assuming an  unchanged  degree  of

pressure in  reserve markets.  Nonetheless, many  of the  members  felt

that  the behavior  of  M2  and M3, whose  growth for  the  year to  date  was

at  the bottom of the Committee's  ranges,  needed to  be monitored with

special  care  and,  at  least  in  one view, that  some  further  easing

measures might  be  desirable in  the near  term to  improve the  prospects

that  monetary expansion  for  the year  would be within  the Committee's

ranges.

Turning to  possible  adjustments  to  the degree  of  reserve

pressure during the intermeeting  period,  a majority of  the  members

indicated  a preference  for  a directive  that  was  biased  at  least

marginally  toward  easing.  Such  a bias was  called  for  in  this  view by

the downside risks  in  the  economy, though  a number  of these members

also felt  that there  should be  no  strong presumption  that  any  easing

would  be undertaken  during the  intermeeting  period  ahead.  The  other

members  indicated  that  they could  support  an  asymmetric  directive

toward  ease though  they preferred  a symmetric  intermeeting  instruc-

tion,  especially in the  context  of  the further  stimulus that  could  be

expected to  result  over  time  from the  earlier monetary easing  actions.

-13-

At  the conclusion  of the Committee's  discussion,  all  of  the

members  indicated  that  they favored a directive that  called  for  main-

taining the  existing degree  of pressure  on reserve  positions.  They

also  noted their preference  or  acceptance  of a directive  that  included

a slight  bias toward possible  easing  during the  intermeeting period.

Accordingly, the Committee  decided that  slightly  greater reserve

restraint might be  acceptable  during the  intermeeting period  or

slightly  lesser  reserve restraint would be  acceptable depending on

progress  toward  price  stability, trends  in  economic  activity, the

behavior  of  the monetary aggregates,  and  developments  in  foreign

exchange and  domestic  financial markets.  The  reserve  conditions

contemplated  at  this meeting were  expected to  be  consistent  with

growth  of M2  and  M3  at  annual  rates  of  around  3 percent  and  1-1/2

percent  respectively  over  the three-month period  from September

through December.

At the  conclusion  of  the meeting, the  following  domestic

policy directive was issued to  the Federal Reserve  Bank  of  New York:

The information  reviewed  at  this  meeting has  been

mixed,  but  it  suggests  on  balance  that  economic
activity has  been expanding at  a moderate pace.  Total
nonfarm payroll  employment  changed  little over  July  and
August,  and  the  civilian unemployment rate was  6.8
percent  in  both months.  Employment  in  manufacturing
continued to  advance  in August,  and  industrial
production  posted  a further  rise  after  several  months
of  sizable  gains.  Consumer  spending  increased
considerably on  balance in  July and  August.  Recent
data  on  orders  and  shipments  of  nondefense  capital
goods  point to  a small  increase in  real  outlays for
business  equipment, but  nonresidential construction  has
remained weak.  Housing starts  rose  only slightly
further  in  July  and August  after  increasing appreciably
on  balance since  January.  The nominal  U.S. merchandise
trade deficit widened  substantially  in  July and was
considerably above its  average  rate  in  the second
quarter.  Increases  in  consumer  prices have  been  small
in  recent months,  owing to  declines  in  food and  energy
prices.

Most  interest  rates have  declined further  since

the  Committee meeting  on August  20.  The Board  of
Governors  approved  a reduction in  the discount  rate
from 5-1/2  to 5 percent  on  September  13.  The trade-
weighted value  of  the  dollar  in terms  of the  other
G-10  currencies  fell  sharply  over  the  intermeeting
period;  much  of the  drop  retraced  the previous  run-up
associated with the  attempted  coup  in the Soviet  Union
that  began  shortly before  the August  Committee meeting.

After  contracting  in  July, M2  was  about  unchanged

in  August  and  September.  M3  declined further  in  July
and  August  and  is  indicated  to  have  changed  little  in
September.  For the year  thus  far,  expansion  of M2  and
M3  has  been  at  the  lower  end  of the  Committee's  ranges.

The Federal Open Market  Committee  seeks  monetary

and  financial conditions  that will foster  price  sta-
bility  and promote  sustainable  growth in  output.  In
furtherance  of these  objectives, the  Committee  at  its
meeting in  July reaffirmed the  ranges  it  had  estab-
lished  in  February for  growth  of  M2  and M3  of  2-1/2  to
6-1/2  percent  and  1 to  5 percent,  respectively,
measured  from the  fourth  quarter  of  1990  to  the fourth
quarter  of  1991.  The  monitoring range for  growth  of
total domestic  nonfinancial  debt  also was maintained  at
4-1/2  to  8-1/2  percent  for  the  year.  For  1992,  on  a
tentative basis,  the Committee agreed  in  July to  use
the  same  ranges  as  in  1991  for  growth  in  each  of  the
monetary  aggregates  and debt,  measured  from the  fourth
quarter  of  1991  to  the  fourth  quarter  of  1992.  With
regard to  M3,  the  Committee  anticipated  that  the
ongoing  restructuring  of  thrift  depository institutions
would continue  to  depress  the  growth  of this  aggregate
relative to  spending and  total  credit.  The behavior  of
the  monetary aggregates will  continue  to  be  evaluated
in the  light  of  progress toward  price level  stability,
movements  in  their  velocities,  and  developments  in the
economy and  financial  markets.

In  the  implementation of  policy  for  the  immediate

future,  the  Committee  seeks  to  maintain the  existing
degree of  pressure  on  reserve  positions.  Depending
upon  progress toward  price  stability, trends  in
economic  activity, the  behavior  of the monetary
aggregates,  and  developments  in  foreign exchange  and
domestic financial  markets,  slightly  greater  reserve
restraint might  or  slightly lesser  reserve restraint
would  be  acceptable  in the  intermeeting  period.  The
contemplated  reserve conditions  are  expected to  be
consistent  with  growth of  M2  and M3  over  the period
from September  through December  at  annual  rates  of
about  3 and  1-1/2  percent,  respectively.

Votes  for  this  action:  Messrs.  Greenspan,

Corrigan,  Angell, Black,  Forrestal, Keehn,
Kelley, LaWare, Mullins,  and  Parry.

Votes  against  this  action:  None.
