## Forecasting Liquidity with Indicators of Financial Stability

This project aims to forecast funding liquidity as a proxy for financial system stability using a set of macroeconomic and financial indicators collected from the previous financial stability literature. Accurate forecasts of liquidity not only inform macroprudential and monetary policy, but also identify the economic variables with the clearest relationship to overall financial stability, providing a clear policy-based motivation for this analysis. Measuring liquidity via bank funding spreads, I utilize lasso regression to fit forecast models of these spreads in the United States and United Kingdom economies based on their one-quarter lagged values and high-dimensional vectors of macro and financial indicators, producing out-of-sample errors up to 15 percent lower than baseline autoregressive models of the spreads. In parallel, I perform natural language processing on the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee to generate a Financial Stability Sentiment score, meant to gauge policymaker opinions of market conditions and provide an alternative measure of overall financial stability. Though modeling sentiment is difficult given the low signal-to-noise ratio of the information content in FOMC minutes, lasso models of the sentiment score produce a more modest 5 percent forecast improvement over a baseline autoregressive model. I then refit these models with simple feed-forward neural networks and obtain much clearer forecast improvement for the U.K. funding spread and the sentiment score. These results contribute to the financial stability literature by highlighting some of the short-run macroeconomic and financial indicators for financial stability, and by demonstrating the utility of machine learning techniques in forecasting within data-rich policy settings.

Here you'll find appendices describing data collection for the Financial Stability Indicators (`data_appendix.xlsx`), data sources (the "final datasets" folder), and code used to run the models and generate results (`figures0.r`); as well as the text of the FOMC minutes used to generate the Financial Stability Sentiment scores (`minutes1` and `minutes2`), and scripts used to parse the minutes and generate the scores (`FSS`). The final product, as submitted to the department for my senior essay, is `thesis.pdf`. Feel free to reach out to eli.metzner28@gmail.com with any questions!
